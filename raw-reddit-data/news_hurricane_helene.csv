This is what happens when we do nothing about climate change and bury our heads in the sand.'}, {'Comment Author': 'gymnastgrrl', 'Comment Body': 'I\'m an untrained amateur weather nerd, but my family and friends generally like the information that I gather from legitimate sources. I\'ve developed a small following. I only say this not to say I\'m amazing, just that others may find this useful as well:\n\n#####1. NHC - http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/ - In particular, pay attention to the NHC Forecaster Discussion. They talk about why the forecast is what it is, as well as what they expect, and how things are trending. If you do nothing else, reading this will help you understand what may change in future forecasts.\n\n#####2. Mike\'s Weather Page -  http://www.spaghettimodels.com/ - now Mike himself gets a bit on the hype side of things. But this page itself is about the best single collection of graphics I\'ve ever found, and he updates it pretty darn well.\n\nNotably, I look at the spaghetti model graphic. This shows where a number of hurricane models show the center of the storm is forecast to go. Sometimes it\'s really tightly clustered, and you can gather that there is a pretty decent change the system will likely go that general direction.  Other times, it\'s a bit more widely spread, so you know to put less emphasis on where the NHC track is centered.\n\nI also look at the SHIPS model, which forecasts strength. There are always outlier models who will forecast it to dissipate or be a Cat 5. But look at the clustering. Right now for TS Milton, there\'s a heavy cluster around Cat 3. This combined with what the NHC forecasters are saying in their discussion leads me to believe this will be likely a Cat 3 system hitting the FL peninsula.\n\nA lot of the other stuff there can be handy, but that\'s what I concentrate on.\n\n#####3. Tropical Tidbits - models page - https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ecmwf&region=seus&pkg=mslp_uv850&fh=0 - that link loads up the EURO model with the 850mb wind and MSLP. You can easily look in the ""Global"" menu to load the GFS. Those are the two models the NHC puts the most weight on.\n\nThis shows the forecasted wind field in the atmosphere - not at ground level. It\'s useful to get an idea of the impact area, althoug the winds aloft will carry much further inland than this model would lead you believe might impact the ground. Don\'t read too much into the land impact per se because very very quickly inland, much of that wind at ground level is diminished by trees.\n\nThat said, this gives an idea of the possible areas the storm may hit harder. For example, Helene was forecast by the various models to be a bit assymmetrical, meaning that the eastern side would get far more impact than the western side. While that\'s generally true because the movement of the storm adds to the east and subtracts from the west, a more symmetrical storm will still impact the western side more in most cases.\n\nIf you poke around, you can find Lower Dynamics ‚Üí MSLP & 10m wind. This models the forecast wind at ground level. Although it seems to me that the wind is typically stronger than these models imply. So while I would discount the displayed wind from the 850mb level, I would say it may be more than the 10m shows. But these are both good perspectives to have, especially after you watch how multiple storms actually develop and compare that to what the models look like.\n\n#####4. Dr. Levi Cohen - https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/ - Levi will often post a daily update when there is a system of interest. He is the single most important source, in my humble opinion, because he explains what\'s going on, why it\'s going on, what environmental conditions are likely to impact the track and strength of the system. He explains things in a non-nonsense way. It\'s a bit technical at first, but after you start to watch and learn, you start to understand. His updates are brilliant, and they are NOT full of hype that so many storm-chaser types fall into.\n\nIf you follow those sources, you will generally gain a much better understanding of what to expect than if you just watch your average television meteorologist. Because I consume this information and regurgitate it / summarize it, my friends and family look to my updates for guidance. It is not to my credit, though, I simply have found these sources of information, and I want to spread them so that more people can make better informed decisions.\n\nIf you\'d like to see what I made of this - here\'s a link to my first update on TS Milton: https://ieh.one/t/ts-milton-expected-to-hit-fl-peninsula-as-cat-3-major-hurricane-wednesday/75\n\nPlease know that I make no money or experience any other benefit from running that site.

I worked for a similar company. A regional vice president insisted that we be open during snowmageddon. I know that women in leadership often get a bad rap, but she was one of the worst leaders that I have ever encountered in my working life. She was just a horrible bitch. She'd visit your stores and have nothing positive to say to anyone. \n\nI remember hearing about her conference calls where she would ask store managers to give input on things and then jump down their throats and rip them a new one for whatever they said. Store managers just learned to keep their mouths shut and not say anything. And of course she got really pissed about that but nobody wanted to stick their necks out because she was so awful.\n\nSo back to snowmageddon. She absolutely despised our district manager. So of course, he's afraid of losing his job, so when she starts talking about how everybody needs to stay open, he wasn't going to stand up to her. So we get the biggest snowstorm two decades and no one's allowed to close early. We finally closed around 9:00 p.m. and by that point, we'd been customer free for hours because of how heavily it was snowing outside.\n\nTo make things worse, that evening before we even closed, the city closed all the freeways and did a state of emergency asking people to stay off the roads because people were getting trapped on the highways. \n\nI was the closing manager that night. I unilaterally sent everybody I could home early and closed the store with just myself and another volunteer. I lived fairly close but I had a hell of a time getting my car through the snow to get home.\n\nSo the morning comes and I call the store manager to see what's going on and he tells me that we all have to go into work. Despite the fact that the roads are impassable and they still have the state of emergency going on in the city that is asking people to stay off the roads.\n\nSo here we are all trying to get into work because she insisted we had to be. We opened 2 hours late and made less than 500 bucks that day because the roads were practically impassable until late in the day. The only reason I was able to get into the store was because I lived a mile and a half away and I walked on the street to get to work. My car was literally buried under five feet of snow and even if I had cleared it, my parking lot also had five of snow on it.\n\nThe only saving grace about the whole thing is there were so many HR complaints about us being forced to stay open during snowmageddon that also kicked off complaints about the RVP regarding just how awful she was to store managers and staff that she was gone a few months later.\n\nI actually saw one of the complaints on our LP manager's laptop one day a week or two later. It was some guy in the district who was an EMT who wrote a scathing letter to corporate about just how dangerous the decision to stay open during an extreme weather event was.""}, {'Comment Author': 'ghost_warlock', 'Comment Body': 'I try to keep perspective for times like those.

The damage elsewhere was also significant outside of New Orleans but the disaster in New Orleans is a big factor in how Katrina became such a disaster and drove hundreds of thousands of people out of their homes for good, and the response to it was also pretty terrible. While Helene has devastated many communities it would be pretty hard to reach the devastation level that New Orleans and the surrounding area experienced and to screw up the response as badly as the state and federal governments did. \n\nThat said the fact that there's been a huge amount of damage and death inland will be one thing hampering the response for a little while. This storm was predicted to do the most damage to the Florida coast and the federal and state government probably focused their disaster planning on the Florida coast and they will need to actively shift their efforts to the inland areas that they weren't expecting to get as bad as they did.""}, {'Comment Author': 'MoistyestBread', 'Comment Body': 'I lived through Katrina, in the New Orleans area (I had evacuated thankfully) but we did lose our home to a large tree. Coincidentally, I was in western NC a couple weeks ago. I can‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs not as bad or worse destruction wise. Not death wise because of the high bar New Orleans set, but still sooo many deaths.\n\nHaving gotten to experience this region so recently, I just don‚Äôt see where you even begin to clean up and rebuild. New Orleans and the gulf coast was at least used to hurricanes and flat/accessible by so many avenues. People that lost everything often just restarted their lives in better places like Houston, Dallas, or Atlanta. That‚Äôs not necessarily the case of North Carolinians, but I imagine a lot of people from Western NC will have to do the same. \n\nSadly enough, I also know 2 different people that have moved to towns around Asheville that experienced both Katrina and This event. Tragic. \n\nI‚Äôll tell you one thing, New Orleans would‚Äôve never recovered as quickly or affordable without a certain  cheap labor force that (no pun intended) flooded the area to help.'}, {'Comment Author': 'CFBCoachGuy', 'Comment Body': 'In some ways. But I don‚Äôt really think so. \n\nLike New Orleans during Katrina, the people worst hit have deep ties to the region and have long been marginalized by more powerful people. Already cash-grab schemes have popped up using Helene. Aid will take a long time to come to the hardest-hit areas. But Appalachians are a robust people. They will rebuild. Some of the families hit have maintained their land for five generations- they aren‚Äôt leaving. Also in part because of that, combined with the rural areas affected, we haven‚Äôt seen the looting or civil unrest that we saw in the aftermath of Katrina. \n\nBut the levees failing with Katrina led some people to calling Katrina a ‚Äúman-made disaster‚Äù. This is different. Before Helene, a low pressure system brought two days of rain to southern Appalachia. Rivers were already high before the hurricane hit.\n\nBut, though there were some early reports of dams failures, the dams all held. Some had to open their spillways and a few have structural damage, but they held. This was existing infrastructure doing its job. It‚Äôs hard to say given the death toll that it could‚Äôve been worse, but it could‚Äôve been worse if the dams collapsed. \n\nThe problem here unlike New Orleans and the Katrina-affected areas is the isolation of these communities. Many of these towns have just one or two roadways connecting them with the rest of the world. If those roads are washed out, it can isolate a community for a long time, and building a new road through this area is very hard (even before this storm, the philosophy for maintaining I40 in North Carolina was ‚Äúpatch and pray‚Äù- I40 partially collapsed near the Tennessee border). It took a long time to even *get* to some of these areas (aid just reached the town of Swannanoa last night). Connecting these communities again will require a massive public works project, something that- at least at the moment- will take a very long time. Also particularly bad is that many of these towns rely on tourism, which is pretty much out of the question for the foreseeable future.\n\nI don‚Äôt think this will hold in the national psyche like Katrina did. For one, this country doesn‚Äôt really do ‚Äúdisaster-rallying‚Äù anymore. But also the victims are taken into account. \n\nHistorically, people from Appalachia have never attracted sympathy. Appalachian hillbillies have became such a trope that they almost can‚Äôt be viewed in a sympathetic light (especially by white, educated liberals). You can already see comments on posts like this (‚Äúthis is what they get‚Ä¶‚Äù). And even among the people of Appalachia, they know that much of the incoming aid will go to the wealthy outsiders who priced out locals to grab up property to build massive precarious riverside/mountainside vacation homes that have now crumbled. Like Katrina, this will likely lead to further gentrification in an area that has already seen many residents priced out.'}, {'Comment Author': 'StockHand1967', 'Comment Body': 'This is Americas worst storm in recorded history. \n\nMaybe during dinosaur times but no..1000 miles of death and destruction.. never seen that before'}, {'Comment Author': 'omojos', 'Comment Body': 'Yes it is like it already.

And I know without more context it's hard to understand, but in the 17 years I've lived here I've seen the creek rise quickly but never as fast as it did that night. It went from barely having anything in it to my bridge which is about 15 ft off the ground in 15 minutes. 10 minutes later it's spilled the banks and was on the road. And I'm in a pretty high spot. A lot of my neighbors weren't so lucky. Nothing like what's going on now, but still. That taught me a lesson about how fast things can happen. \n\nSo this storm, I'm reassessing my preparedness. I would have told you last week that I was more than prepared for something like this. I'm not even close. Not to mention, even though I don't think the water would ever get higher than me standing on my kitchen counters mainly because of the lay of the land, I never considered my house getting swept off the foundation and floating away. I could totally see that happening. I have four ways out, three of which involve little bridges over the creek where they would definitely be washed away. The last option is a very steep Hill that I can imagine would have a lot of slips. It's already trying to slip behind my neighbor's house across the street. So I don't even know if that's an option. I never considered being that stuck. In theory, I could walk out one of the ways as it is the most flat-ish, but it would probably take me at least an entire day, require a lot of hiking skills, and I just don't know if I'm capable of that anymore. I'm not very young.  \n\nWhat's even harder is when we have had bad flooding due to flash floods, it's really hard to pinpoint exactly where it's going to happen. That makes it hard to know where to evacuate to. It all depends on where that concentration of rain is going to be.

Hurricanes rarely do much damage that far inland, especially in the mountains where they slow down. So for people here in Western NC, it was not an expectation. People living down by the coast have far more experience and knowledge of how hurricanes work, and how to prepare. Not so in the mountains. Hell, a lot of people moved up from Florida in recent years to Buncombe County under the idea that the weather would be better.\n\n2. People were not told to leave, rather there was a shelter in place order. There was no mandatory evacuation notice until very shortly before - because at first Helene was not expected to hit NC this hard. But by that point, cell towers had started to fall, and folks already started losing power. And people trying to leave started encountering rising waters that made leaving dangerous. The roads were starting to get backed up. If you're gonna be stuck, better to be stuck in your house rather than your car.\n\n3. People can't leave. Homeless people, people without cars, people without money to afford supplies, people who can't get enough gas, people who can't afford a hotel, people who can't find a place that allows pets. Some folks didn't have the ability to move disabled and elderly family on that short a notice. Tons of reasons prevent someone from leaving. \n\n4. People don't want to leave. Leaving all of your belongings, all of your animals (for rural folk), your home that you bought or inherited, your business, your entire livelihood to a storm? That's not always an easy decision. Psychologically I think a lot of people want to protect what's theirs. I know people that have stayed on land passed down by their family for a couple hundred years. That's not easy to leave to the elements. People don't want their house or business looted, a justifiable concern.

The NHC forecast discussion. Available here: http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/ - go to any system and look for the link to the forecast discussion.\n2. Mike\'s Weather page - please note that Mike gets a little..... hyper. I use his site as the most convenient place to find most of the forecast graphics in one convenient location: http://www.spaghettimodels.com/ - his page is the easiest way to get to the Tropical Tidbits page for a particular system, e.g. https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/storminfo/#09L\n3. Tropical Tidbits has a number of amazing models - this is the one I usually start with: https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ecmwf&region=seus&pkg=mslp_uv850&fh=0\n4. Tropical Tidbits itself - Dr. Levi Cowen gives fantastic science-based no-hype updates. Not only about where the system is, but what factors will affect how it strengthens and where it will go. It\'s a bit in depth and requires much watching to learn, but it\'s worth it: https://www.youtube.com/@Tropical-Tidbits\n\nThose are my sources. I avoid hype, and use the NHC and/or the same sources the NHC uses.\n\nI\'m not better than the NHC - I ***use*** the NHC. I *am* better than a lot of media personalities that don\'t look at these sources. It seems like many of them just look at the NHC cone and basic summary and go from there. But thanks to the expertise of Dr. Cowen, as well as  having access to things like the spaghetti models and ensembles and such, I understand what the NHC forecasters are saying, and I can make better informed decisions than most who listen to most of the televised media. I\'m not claiming to be smart. I just listen to the people who are smart.\n\nSo please, before you smugly write some stupid bullshit about ""believing some girl on the internet"", realize that this conversation started as I replied to some random dude on the internet spouting something with ZERO science to back it up. And I\'ve listed my sources.\n\nYou believe what you want to, that\'s fine.

Climate Change:\n\nQuote: ""Together, these form a colossal operation that has become one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry and, as such, is harmful to future U.S. prosperity. This industry‚Äôs mission emphasis on prediction and management seems designed around the fatal conceit of planning for the unplannable.""\n\nPage: 675\n\nExplanation: This quote critiques the government and various industries involved in climate change initiatives. It suggests that the efforts to predict and manage climate change are based on the flawed assumption that these complex environmental issues can be controlled. The document sees this as damaging to the future economic prosperity of the U.S.\n\nQuote: ""The Biden Administration has incorporated its radical climate policy into every USAID initiative...The aid industry claims that climate change causes poverty, which is false. Enduring conflict, government corruption, and bad economic policies are the main drivers of global poverty.""\n\nPage: 257-258\n\nExplanation: This passage criticizes the Biden Administration‚Äôs approach to integrating climate change policy into global aid efforts through USAID. It challenges the idea that climate change is a primary cause of poverty, arguing instead that other factors like corruption and poor governance are the main contributors.\n\n\n\n2. National Weather Service (NWS):\n\nQuote: ""The National Weather Service (NWS) provides data that private companies use and should focus on its data-gathering services. Because private companies rely on these data, the NWS should fully commercialize its forecasting operations.""\n\nPage: 675\n\nExplanation: This quote suggests that the NWS should shift its focus to gathering data and leave weather forecasting to private companies. It also calls for the NWS to commercialize its operations, implying that private-sector involvement would enhance efficiency and innovation in weather forecasting.\n\nQuote: ""Review the Work of the National Hurricane Center and the National Environmental Satellite Service...Data continuity is an important issue in climate science.""\n\nPage: 676\n\nExplanation: This passage highlights the importance of reviewing the National Hurricane Center and satellite services in maintaining consistent and reliable data. Continuity of data is considered crucial for accurate climate science and forecasting.\n\n\n\n3. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA):\n\nQuote: ""FEMA is the lead federal agency in preparing for and responding to disasters, but it is overtasked, overcompensates for the lack of state and local preparedness and response, and is regularly in deep debt.""\n\nPage: 153-154\n\nExplanation: This quote points out that FEMA is stretched thin due to the high demand for its services and the insufficient disaster preparedness at state and local levels. As a result, the agency is often in debt, implying that FEMA‚Äôs resources are being overused and that state and local governments need to take on more responsibility.\n\nQuote: ""Under the Stafford Act, FEMA has the authority to adjust the per capita indicator for damages, which creates a threshold under which states and localities are not eligible for public assistance.""\n\nPage: 154\n\nExplanation: This quote refers to FEMA‚Äôs authority under the Stafford Act to set damage thresholds that determine whether states and localities qualify for federal disaster aid. By adjusting the per capita indicator, FEMA can manage the distribution of resources more effectively and ensure that only those in greatest need receive assistance.'}, {'Comment Author': '4x4taco', 'Comment Body': '> They closed the Waffle Houses\n\nThis is the ultimate indicator of how serious this is.'}, {'Comment Author': 'panda_nectar', 'Comment Body': 'Waffle House is actually boarded up'}, {'Comment Author': 'DrZeroH', 'Comment Body': 'If they told the flordia folk that that might genuinely be enough to strike the fear of god in them.'}, {'Comment Author': 'SlightlyControversal', 'Comment Body': 'And put an axe in your attic.

A tropical storm watch was raised Monday afternoon for Florida‚Äôs Dry Tortugas and part of the Keys. Additional alerts will be issued for the US in the coming days, with a potential landfall in Florida expected perhaps as soon Thursday evening.\n\nFlorida wasted no time getting preparations underway. Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency ahead of the storm for 41 the state‚Äôs 67 counties, according to a Monday press release. The move helps to expedite preparations and coordination between the state and local governments.\n\nPotential Tropical Cyclone Nine is a disorganized mass of showers and thunderstorms churning in the far western\xa0Caribbean Sea. This stormy weather will drop potentially flooding rainfall over portions of Central America, Mexico, Cuba and Jamaica as it tries to organize into a tropical system.\n\nWhile its exact track and strength could change, Helene will track north over the extremely warm waters into the Gulf of Mexico which will likely supercharge it on its collision course\xa0with the US Gulf Coast.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center is forecasting Helene to\xa0rapidly intensify\xa0and eventually become a Category 3 hurricane over a\xa0record-warm\xa0Gulf of Mexico ‚Äì a feat becoming\xa0more likely\xa0as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution.\n\nStrong, potentially damaging winds and storm surge are likely near where the system ultimately comes ashore. The system will also churn up seas in the Gulf and could produce rough surf and dangerous rip currents for much of the basin, especially later this week.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center is showing a landfall in Florida‚Äôs Big Bend region, but anyone from Florida‚Äôs Gulf Coast to eastern Louisiana should be on alert this week.\n\nConfidence in the system‚Äôs exact track will increase after it forms, since forecast models struggle to accurately pinpoint where it could go without a center to lock onto.\n\nEnsemble forecast models ‚Äì groupings of many model runs initiated with slight differences to show a wide range of outcomes ‚Äì are focusing on the eastern Gulf Coast as the area most likely for a landfall later this week. When ensemble tracks bunch closer together it means there‚Äôs more confidence in the track.\n\nThere‚Äôs a closer grouping with this storm along the eastern Gulf Coast, but given it hasn‚Äôt formed yet it‚Äôs not a guarantee.\n\nTampa General Hospital began erecting a 10-foot-high flood barrier around the facility Monday because of the chance for storm surge and shifts in the storm‚Äôs track with little time to prepare. The level one trauma center‚Äôs location next to Hillsborough Bay makes it extremely storm surge prone.\n\nIt takes three days for a 60 person team to fully erect the barrier to encase the hospital and work will continue ‚Äúunless we see a forecast favorable enough to stop,‚Äù Dustin Pasteur, the vice president of facilities and construction at the hospital said. ‚ÄúI just couldn‚Äôt afford to lose a day waiting.‚Äù\n\nRegardless of its exact track, heavy rainfall is possible for much of the Southeast starting around midweek. A level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rain is in place for much of Florida, Georgia, Alabama and parts of the Carolinas Thursday, according to the Weather Prediction Center.\n\nThe system‚Äôs danger won‚Äôt end after landfall either. Helene could bring strong winds and torrential rainfall to much of Georgia and the Carolinas by Friday. This could lead to dangerous flooding and significant power outages.\n\nAnother impactful storm for the US and Florida\n\nHelene is forecast to become the fourth hurricane to make landfall in the US this year. The three others all rapidly intensified before striking the US as hurricanes:\xa0Beryl,\xa0Debby\xa0and\xa0Francine.\n\nThe last time four or more hurricanes hit the US in one season was the\xa0devastating 2020\xa0season.\n\nDespite the rash of impactful storms, if Helene manages to landfall as a Category 3 it would be the first major hurricane to do so in the US since\xa0Idalia\xa0slammed into Florida‚Äôs Big Bend last August.\n\nHelene would continue a brutal stretch for the Sunshine State. Helene is forecast to be the fifth hurricane to slam Florida since 2022. The repeated blows have\xa0pushed the insurance market in the state to the brink, with insurers pulling out of the state because of the increasing risk of extreme weather due to climate change.\n\nCNN‚Äôs Isabel Rosales contributed to this report.'}, {'Comment Author': 'DonRaccoonote', 'Comment Body': 'Please become a spirit bomb and annihilate frieza, I mean Ron desantis.\xa0'}, {'Comment Author': 'Misstucson', 'Comment Body': 'As someone who has never experienced a hurricane but is traveling throughout Florida on October 5th.
