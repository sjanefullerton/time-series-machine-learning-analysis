But it\'s not just the country it\'s the world America seems to be the epicenter and barometer for the bullshit.\n\nAnyway I have a family that were had to leave Georgia and they said the power won\'t be back until the 9th of October, luckily they had family close byin the house didn\'t take much damage just some shingles.'}, {'Comment Author': 'electric4568', 'Comment Body': 'is that the Sid the sloth from Ice Age'}, {'Comment Author': 't635l', 'Comment Body': 'Have you heard from your mom?'}, {'Comment Author': 'Aureliusmind', 'Comment Body': 'I know a bunch of power line technicians in Vancouver BC who have been deployed to here to help get power back online. Why on earth is your nation having to rent Canadians?'}, {'Comment Author': 'generaloptimist', 'Comment Body': 'It\'s good to bring attention to this stuff, because the people still there need help, of course.  But also, unfortunately, shit happens everywhere.  \n\nHouston, TX, has entered the chat.  A swollen river on a mountainside is bad, but when 40+ inches of rain fall on a city at sea level, there\'s simply nowhere for the water to go.  And that\'s a city of 6 million people, not to mention the millions throughout East texas and Louisiana who endured that storm. \n\nNew Orleans has some thoughts as well.  They\'re no stranger to floods.\n\nHell, most places in Texas were without power for a week or more during the coldest weather they\'ve ever known in 2021, and it took weeks-to-months to restore water in some places.  Some estimates suggest more than 500 people died—just from the cold. \n\nNot to compare catastrophes, but I have a feeling that the scale of impacts from storms like Katrina and Harvey (and the aforementioned winter storm)will dwarf what\'s felt in the wake of Helene.  \n\n\nThen there\'s the fact that Helene was very well predicted.  People in Ashville and elsewhere should have been prepared.  They should have been gone.  They had time.  We can say this after almost every natural disaster these days, of course. \n\nWe knew where it would make landfall.  We knew where it would go from there.  We knew that it was going to carry uncommon winds well up into northern Georgia, and we knew that it was going to dump insane amounts of rain in NC.\n\nOn Tuesday, the NHC (let alone local forecasters who focus on things other than coastal cyclones) advised that considerable flooding was expected for the southern Appalachians and the Tennessee Valley.  They noted the risk of landslides and ""isolated major river flooding is possible.""  At that time, Helene was a tropical storm near Cayman Islands. \n\nAs the track gained confidence, they upgraded their warnings.  By Wednesday morning, ""considerable and potentially life-threatening flooding is expected.""\n\nSoon after, that was upgraded to ""Considerable and locally catastrophic"" flooding, with warnings of high wind gusts in the higher terrain.  By that night, it was ""Catastrophic and life-threatening flooding, including numerous landslides, is expected"" for the area.  The storm was passing Cuba at this time. \n\nThey bumped it up to ""numerous significant landslides"" overnight Wednesday, along with ""Widespread significant river flooding and isolated major river flooding.""  Surely, people would have left their small mountain towns for more stable, less flood-prone, terrain, yes?  \n\nBy Thursday night, anyone who wasn\'t listening was running out of time, so they added that residents in Northern Georgia and the Carolinas, particularly the southern Appalachian region, should be prepared for ""long-duration power outages.""\n\nBy Friday morning, all they could do was report the news.  ""Historic, catastrophic, and life-threatening flooding, including numerous significant landslides, will continue...""  They acknowledged that the scale of the flooding will be widespread, and ""major to record breaking.""\n\nI understand that not everyone has the means and ability to leave their home behind and evacuate.  All kinds of things keep people from heeding those warnings. \n\nThe flooding wrought by Helene was devastating.  But it was anticipated.  Residents there should not have been caught off guard.  They shouldn\'t be trapped and cut off from help.  They should be safe, in a shelter, where their local officials instructed them to go, multiple days before the flooding began.  \n\nWhen you see consistent, repeated, and increasingly dire predictions of an impending disaster in your area, pay attention and _act_, people.  Tell your neighbors.  Tell your family.  Tell everyone you can to get the hell out of there, on your way the hell out of there.  Don\'t be part of the disaster.'}, {'Comment Author': 'Maximum-Mastodon3344', 'Comment Body': 'On the MS gulf coast, after Katrina, we were without power for 3 weeks & 2 days.

For more than a century, that event has loomed large as the area’s flood of record.\n\n>But that title now belongs to Helene instead, and for good reason. The scale of the impacts was broader and the mountain landscape much more developed now compared to 108 years ago. Because of that, the damage is certain to exceed the inflation-adjusted $641 million from the 1916 storm, likely by an order of magnitude. For reference, Florence caused an estimated $17 billion in damage in the state.\n\n>At the few river gauges in the region that observed both Helene and the 1916 storm, the crests since Helene have broken those long-standing records. The French Broad River and Swannanoa River – which collided at high speeds and high volumes in 1916 to overtake Biltmore Village – both saw new record crests during and after Helene.\n\n>The French Broad River in Asheville rose 1.5 feet above its previous highest crest, and downstream at Blantyre, the river surpassed its 1916 crest and was still rising when the gauge stopped reporting on Friday afternoon.\n\n>The Swannanoa River at Biltmore crested at 26.1 feet, more than five feet above its 1916 maximum and slightly above the apparent 26-foot crest in April 1791, making this effectively the worst flood along the river since North Carolina became a state.'}, {'Comment Author': 'cowbyLevelup', 'Comment Body': 'Because it’s hideous.

No sailor ever wants to be in a small boat in a big storm.
