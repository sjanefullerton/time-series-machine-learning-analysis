But also, unfortunately, shit happens everywhere.  \n\nHouston, TX, has entered the chat.  A swollen river on a mountainside is bad, but when 40+ inches of rain fall on a city at sea level, there\'s simply nowhere for the water to go.  And that\'s a city of 6 million people, not to mention the millions throughout East texas and Louisiana who endured that storm. \n\nNew Orleans has some thoughts as well.  They\'re no stranger to floods.\n\nHell, most places in Texas were without power for a week or more during the coldest weather they\'ve ever known in 2021, and it took weeks-to-months to restore water in some places.  Some estimates suggest more than 500 people died‚Äîjust from the cold. \n\nNot to compare catastrophes, but I have a feeling that the scale of impacts from storms like Katrina and Harvey (and the aforementioned winter storm)will dwarf what\'s felt in the wake of Helene.  \n\n\nThen there\'s the fact that Helene was very well predicted.  People in Ashville and elsewhere should have been prepared.  They should have been gone.  They had time.  We can say this after almost every natural disaster these days, of course. \n\nWe knew where it would make landfall.  We knew where it would go from there.  We knew that it was going to carry uncommon winds well up into northern Georgia, and we knew that it was going to dump insane amounts of rain in NC.\n\nOn Tuesday, the NHC (let alone local forecasters who focus on things other than coastal cyclones) advised that considerable flooding was expected for the southern Appalachians and the Tennessee Valley.  They noted the risk of landslides and ""isolated major river flooding is possible.""  At that time, Helene was a tropical storm near Cayman Islands. \n\nAs the track gained confidence, they upgraded their warnings.  By Wednesday morning, ""considerable and potentially life-threatening flooding is expected.""\n\nSoon after, that was upgraded to ""Considerable and locally catastrophic"" flooding, with warnings of high wind gusts in the higher terrain.  By that night, it was ""Catastrophic and life-threatening flooding, including numerous landslides, is expected"" for the area.  The storm was passing Cuba at this time. \n\nThey bumped it up to ""numerous significant landslides"" overnight Wednesday, along with ""Widespread significant river flooding and isolated major river flooding.""  Surely, people would have left their small mountain towns for more stable, less flood-prone, terrain, yes?  \n\nBy Thursday night, anyone who wasn\'t listening was running out of time, so they added that residents in Northern Georgia and the Carolinas, particularly the southern Appalachian region, should be prepared for ""long-duration power outages.""\n\nBy Friday morning, all they could do was report the news.  ""Historic, catastrophic, and life-threatening flooding, including numerous significant landslides, will continue...""  They acknowledged that the scale of the flooding will be widespread, and ""major to record breaking.""\n\nI understand that not everyone has the means and ability to leave their home behind and evacuate.  All kinds of things keep people from heeding those warnings. \n\nThe flooding wrought by Helene was devastating.  But it was anticipated.  Residents there should not have been caught off guard.  They shouldn\'t be trapped and cut off from help.  They should be safe, in a shelter, where their local officials instructed them to go, multiple days before the flooding began.  \n\nWhen you see consistent, repeated, and increasingly dire predictions of an impending disaster in your area, pay attention and _act_, people.  Tell your neighbors.  Tell your family.  Tell everyone you can to get the hell out of there, on your way the hell out of there.  Don\'t be part of the disaster.'}, {'Comment Author': 'Maximum-Mastodon3344', 'Comment Body': 'On the MS gulf coast, after Katrina, we were without power for 3 weeks & 2 days.

The scale of the impacts was broader and the mountain landscape much more developed now compared to 108 years ago. Because of that, the damage is certain to exceed the inflation-adjusted $641 million from the 1916 storm, likely by an order of magnitude. For reference, Florence caused an estimated $17 billion in damage in the state.\n\n>At the few river gauges in the region that observed both Helene and the 1916 storm, the crests since Helene have broken those long-standing records. The French Broad River and Swannanoa River ‚Äì which collided at high speeds and high volumes in 1916 to overtake Biltmore Village ‚Äì both saw new record crests during and after Helene.\n\n>The French Broad River in Asheville rose 1.5 feet above its previous highest crest, and downstream at Blantyre, the river surpassed its 1916 crest and was still rising when the gauge stopped reporting on Friday afternoon.\n\n>The Swannanoa River at Biltmore crested at 26.1 feet, more than five feet above its 1916 maximum and slightly above the apparent 26-foot crest in April 1791, making this effectively the worst flood along the river since North Carolina became a state.'}, {'Comment Author': 'cowbyLevelup', 'Comment Body': 'Because it‚Äôs hideous.

No sailor ever wants to be in a small boat in a big storm. To think it was a decision he chose is ignorant or the realities of sailing. \n\nHelene took only two days to intensify in the Gulf of Mexico and was category 4. You can only sail so fast either in the direction that is different to its potential path and hope it's not so big that it hits you, or changes direction, which also may be difficult as the waves increase in height and their direction may work for or against you, or you try to race it to shore so you can safely dock and bunker down. Ultimately it comes down to math, with your coordinates, speed, the wind direction, the wave height and direction and the fast moving beast bearing down on you that it's throwing worse weather and waves that will work against you.
