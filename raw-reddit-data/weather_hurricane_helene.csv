Historically, there have been MANY hurricanes that strike the Gulf and SE coast, then move inland and weaken to tropical storms that track over the southern Appalachians causing severe flooding. That is actually not an unusual event. Of course, the details make all the difference. A huge factor here was that the southern Appalachians received a huge amount of rain in the week prior to Helene. There was already flooding prior to Helene! So when Helene arrived, it was the final nail in the coffin so to speak. On edit...I just want to add an example. Hurricane Camille was catastrophic as it hit Mississippi in 1969. BY the time it reached the southern Appalachians it was just a tropical depression.

Earthquakes, tornadoes, flooding, rock slides, mud slides, icy roads, avalanche, wildfire, drought, snowed in, lightening, heat wave, volcanic activity, I'm sure I'm missing some.\nSo, before passing judgment on us living in this tropical paradise that yes, it has a few months of potential catastrophic destruction. Take a look around your community. What dangers are lurking around you. What fear do you sacrifice  to live in the place of your choosing. The place you call home.\nThe world is changing people. You have a choice. You can fight it, to no avail. The United States experienced\xa089 severe natural disasters in 2023. With this change maybe consider deeper into your hearts of compassion and help a fellow neighbor out who is in need. If you can, help. \nThere is too much hate in the world. It's a lot easier and i promise it feels so much better to just be kind and supportive. FIrst to yourself and ultimately to one another.""}, {'Comment Author': 'Nocoffeesnob', 'Comment Body': ""No, there have been dozens of near misses.

My father was in the process of selling his house and was supposed to close on it on Monday 9/30, unfortunately the town home he was selling is located in a flood zone and the house was not insured, the house was supposed to sell for 140k, but the entire first floor of the house and every house in the neighborhood was completely destroyed due to flooding. As I said, the house was completely destroyed, the entire first floor is currently underwater, the kitchen and its appliances are wrecked, floors, walls, any and all furniture. He did not have insurance on the house due to it being located in a flood zone. My father is now completely out of money as all of his savings were invested in the house. I have never owned a house and I don’t have much knowledge on what to do in the situation. Is there any possible way he can get any money for the house without insurance, tax write offs… relief… anything at all? If anyone can give me any advice or information I would be very grateful.

Have some LifeStraw filters since I have no way to boil water. Making do with bread, peanut butter, and crackers for food.\n\nPeople have been looting & siphoning/stealing gas. It's apocalyptically bad. There are two shelters open but roads are still blocked by trees, plus with no car or gas can't reach them anyway. Hoping it gets better soon but we're on day 5 now with little help.\n\nTrying to keep it together mentally but not gonna lie, it's fucking rough right now. Plus with everything closed & my car trashed I can't make it to work, so no way to pay my bills right now. This is definitely one of those times in life where you realize just how good things were before, even if they were stressful. At least then I had a way of supporting myself & my cats.

It’s probably still too early to tell. Asheville and surrounding towns will recover quicker just because that will be needed in the long term to support the less populated counties. When I went to WCU Asheville was the closest hospital for “serious stuff” and the whole region needs that capacity back online. The true recovery in places like chimney rock will take years and it’ll never be quite the same. \n\nI’ve been running supplies up and down the mountain to Asheville County today and that county is a good example of what’s going on overall from what I’ve heard on the ground. \n\nJefferson and West Jefferson are mainly back up and running now but there are so many people still needing immediate help in other parts of the county like Lansing and Helton. \n\nIt’s just such a monumental task to get to some of these places and the people there can’t get out to get help unless you’re an able bodied adult with no children who can navigate the altered terrain. \n\nI have a co-worker who has been stuck at their house since it happened and we didn’t even get confirmation she was alive until Sunday night. \n\nSo the very long answer to your question is I’d guess a year before some of these places are fully functional again and years to completely rebuild. Some of these communities will be forever reshaped by the sheer amount of mudslides. \n\nTo end on a positive note the people I’ve talked to today are OVERWHELMED but keeping their chins up. There’s a supply station at the old Ashe High School everyone there is on a mission and coming up with innovative ways to help people navigate available resources. \n\nIMPORTANT! \n\nSome of the biggest requests were obvious and some weren’t. I think it’s going to be especially important to keep people informed about the needs as they change based on the situation. Right now in Ashe County the biggest needs are:\n\nWATER, BENADRYL, DIAPERS, and LIGHT (C or D batteries, flashlights with corresponding batteries, and one I’ve heard a lot of people using is the little solar lights that you can put in your yard. The list may be completely different next by next week so we need to be responsive to be effective.'}, {'Comment Author': 'blackermon', 'Comment Body': 'We’ve got friends doing the same from down east - they mentioned generators, batteries, lights, medicines, chainsaws, etc., and also had the exact same follow-up that these needs may change week to week or even day to day.  I desperately want to help in any way possible, and I’ve been thinking that it might be useful to have some kind of website or app where folks can list their needs and those able and willing to help can know where to bring supplies.  It would take a decent amount of effort to ensure responsible coordination with third party organizations and all of that, but damn I feel like it could help.  So many folks are sending money, but if we could enable folks to provide supplies, and then be reimbursed by others who cannot help directly, it may increase access to goods and services more immediately.  I fear they’ll have plenty of money available in some fund, but not in their hands to spend, and with few places to spend it.  Part of me is sure there’s already something being set up that will far exceed my capabilities, but then I wonder if everyone is thinking that, or assuming our government will be responsive and creative, and maybe they just won’t.  Anyway- going to go look at prices of needed goods, see how much we can send, and see exactly what this project would entail.  Thank you for your detailed, honest response, and thank you for your help to these communities.  We know some vulnerable folks up there, and I know there are so many more with stories of their own.  They just need help.'}]"

Its also the THIRD most populous state with over 20 million residents. You think its a better idea to clog up the roads and have over a dozen million residents try to go somewhere else, usually without a guarantee that there will be a place for them?\n\n You also dont think a lot of these ppl have to go to work? I remember when that one hurricane (Ian?) in fall 2017 hit, a friend of mine down in TX was yelling at me that my family was dumb for not evacuating... when my mom literally had to work the next day because she was a medical professional and not everyone was working at your local Taco Bell and can simply ""close.""? Clinics and hospitals are even MORE essential after a hurricane. \n\n Let alone where y\'all expected my family to go. \n\n I lived in Florida for 18 years... lived through many a hurricane, most notable were Charlie, Katrina and Wilma. Unless you are in a coastal flood zone (Perry is way inland) then you are best staying put and boarding your windows and getting supplies and ride it out. \n\nFloridians can be stupid, but not evacuating (again besides those on the beach) is the smartest thing they can do during a hurricane. It aint Louisiana where if you go west you are in Texas and if you go north you are in Arkansas and east you are in Mississippi...\n\n In FL... only one real direction to go at least until you reach I-10 and then theres still a LOT of Florida'}, {'Comment Author': 'None', 'Comment Body': '[deleted]'}, {'Comment Author': 'Mikewold58', 'Comment Body': 'What are you even talking about?

Yea, a tree branch can snap and hurl at them, but for the most part... its just wind and rain. The dangerous aspect of a hurricane is debris and this field doesnt look like its at a high debris risk compared to a more urban area where you can have pieces of metal, plastic, wood etc. more likely to go flying. \n\n  I aint encouraging anyone to do this, do whatever you want, but theres nowhere near as much a danger risk in this video as in those morons that wanna go surfing or swimming. \n\n I been out in incelement weather. Its exhilerating, but you gotta be careful. During Katrina and Wilma when it was calmer, but still stormy, me and my family would sit on the backporch and watch the storm. Hey, the power was out! We gotta entertain ourselves somehow! One of my favourite memories of Katrina was throwing a sandal up in the air and watching the wind boomerang it and hit my brother in the face with it! \n\n Life is too short to be afraid of weather all the time. But be reasonable. Dont go snorkelling in flood waters and dont go surfing during Hurricane Andrew. Its okay to get a little wet but if an oak tree decides to give you a hug .. thats the risk you take.""}]"

Large storm in Southeast US before Hurricane Helene?,"On Thursday 9/26, the night that Hurricane Helene made landfall in the United States, there was a large storm system moving across the Southern US.

This could include non-rotating convective storms, and cyclonic storms of any kind. The term is also generically vague enough that it doesn\'t require the storm to be located anywhere in the midlatitudes, as the Pacific Ocean includes the equator, where storms are inherently different.\n\nThe correct answer is extratropical cyclone. Synonyms I have heard for ""extratropical cyclone"" include ""midlatitude cyclone"", or for storms over the Northeast US/Midwest, a ""Nor\'easter"" or ""Alberta clipper.""

Rain potential of hurricanes,"We have normally been concerned about the wind speed of hurricanes. However, in recent years, hurricanes have picked up more water and delivered more rain than in the past. Now, a major threat of hurricanes is not just the wind but also the rain and flooding. That was particularly the case with Helene and western North Carolina.

We have the categories of hurricanes based on their wind speed. Is there any scale or measure of the relative amount of moisture or rainfall from a hurricane? There should be. Even a hurricane that, based on wind speed, is considered ""minor"" or ""category 1"" can do quite a bit of damage due to flooding because of rain.

The way to currently predict flood impacts is by flood zones and historical data from those zones, by relative elevation. The problem again is, a house that didn’t flood in 1962 is now surrounded by hard surfaces of roads, parking lots, buildings so you can estimate its flood potential due to elevation relative to the surrounding area. but beyond that it’s probably impossible to estimate the actual damage of the water.  Rising but Standing and moving water are two totally different types of damage. \nIn the hurricane forecast is the estimate of rain which it will produce, but I’m sure the same error factor applies to a regular thunderstorm rain prediction also. Another factor is not the rain you get, but the rain a place which ultimately drains to you gets. Like a mountain storm 100+ miles away causes a flash flood in the desert.'}]"
Hurricane Remnants,"The leftovers of Helene hung around TN for a few days and I’m curious. 

How do hurricanes stay together after they’ve weakened? It appeared even in its weak state that it kept its structure.

I have a question about hurricanes,Ok so I'm from Indianapolis and don't know much about hurricanes. When hurricane Helene made landfall as a cat 4 with 140mph winds how come the reporters in the eye wall were only experiencing like 80mph? Where do they get the 140mph from?,https://www.reddit.com/r/weather/comments/1fqod0l/i_have_a_question_about_hurricanes/,1727445491.0,jaymcskywalker,weather,"[{'Comment Author': 'Questions_Remain', 'Comment Body': 'The ground itself causes friction which slows the winds at ground level. The official wind speed is measured at about 30 feet above the ground and averaged or taken by aircraft at a higher altitude and then reduced to estimate a ground level speed.  Plus any object at ground level like a building, truck, trees anywhere around the person measuring will affect the wind speed as the wind bounces off and swirls around fixed object.  The reporters aren’t standing in the middle of a multi acre flat open lot on a 30 ft ladder away from any property or protection. Most you see are just outside a building or in the middle of a street. Sure ( some are at the beach ) but even then, they are measuring 6 feet off the ground at best with a dune or something rising close by.'}, {'Comment Author': 'jaymcskywalker', 'Comment Body': 'I appreciate you so much!'}]"
