Quick Update on the Biden-Harris Administration’s Response to Hurricane Helene.,"Our Administration continues to work around the clock to make sure communities in South Carolina have everything they need to recover and rebuild. So far, FEMA has approved over $77.2 million in assistance for more than 96,000 households.  
  
Our Administration will not leave until the job is done. We encourage survivors to apply for FEMA assistance, which can be done by:  
- Calling 1-800-621-3362  
- Visiting [DisasterAssistance.gov](http://DisasterAssistance.gov)

Like, my power was out for 6 days and the food in my fridge and freezer went bad, now the power is on and I've gotten groceries to replace them.  It's my understanding that FEMA is offering money to help offset this cost, so I'd like to utilize that benefit if I am able.  The questions are asking about damage to my home; there was a small leak in my roof, but that wasn't what caused the the power to go out or the food to spoil.  I will need to fix the leak, but I don't know if that's really the type of damage they're asking about. Does the power being out count as damage to my home for this?  It asks if I need help with Critical Needs, including food, but then it makes it sound like that's intended to apply to people who literally need food brought to them right now so they don't go hungry.  I don't understand what answers to give to these questions to accurately convey my current situation or if that should be a sign that my current situation would not qualify for this assistance.""}, {'Comment Author': 'CrazyLibraryLady', 'Comment Body': 'If you can, go to a disaster relief center and fill out the forms with an agent'}, {'Comment Author': 'SCYoungLawyer', 'Comment Body': 'The South Carolina Bar has set up a toll-free legal aid hotline for individuals who live in affected counties.

And Project 2025, backed by Trump supporters, would restructure FEMA to limit aid to states and says that the National Weather Service, which provides crucial data on hurricanes and other storms, “should be broken up and downsized.”\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development Inspector General found that the White House delayed the release of $8.3 billion in HUD disaster aid for Puerto Rico that Congress approved in February 2018.

There are lines down all over the place and the electric co-op where he is is stepping and fetching. Most trees are cleared to some degree, except those wrapped up in power lines. \nWe went to Woodruff on our way to see dad, and it's not nearly as bad as it expected.  It's bad, but not like we had been told. There is little to no cell service.  \nWoodruff road, once you get past the traffic circles, is in better shape than I imagined. Power was spotty. \n\nI've heard some parts of Union on Broad River co-op are back up, but certainly not all. The guy I talked to there Saturday said the power was up at his house.\n\nSome church members in Duncan said they are still without power, but parts of Greer are coming online. \n\nAnother church member in the Slater area said it's bad but the Spinx station had gas at lunch time. \n\nA friend in the Powdersville area said they lost a lot of trees and still have no power. \n\nWe are dealing with a lot of destruction here in the upstate, I have family in McDowell county that said it's unbelievable how bad it is there, mainly due to flooding. \n\nAll things considered, we are okay.

I did because I was turned away, or tried to at least 😏. Was it actually FEMA? No. However was FEMA using law enforcement and other government agencies to help turn people away.   And this who thing about FEMA not giving money illegal aliens is false too. September 16, 2022 the White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre announced during a press conference that “funding is also available through FEMA’s emergency food and shelter program to eligible local governments and non profit organizations upon request to support humanitarian relief for migrants”. Some people will say “they’re not do that”. So either the White House lied in 2022 or they are lying now. Ether way they lied to the American people. \n\n“The FAA is restricting access to the airspace for Helene rescue and recovery operations.”…no they are not but they have now stepped in and made it a paperwork nightmare for anyone who what’s to step up and help with their own personal aircraft.    \n\n“Rumor: FEMA is confiscating donations for survivors.“. No, technically FEMA is not physically confiscating donations…they are once again using local law enforcement and other government agencies to “direct” confiscating donations such as water to where they, FEMA, thinks it should be stored for later. This again is word play from FEMA. \n\n“Rumor: FEMA will only provide $750 to disaster survivors to support their recovery.”. $750? Funny thing is my Aunt and Uncle who lives in Hendersonville had been turned down for the money and have filled out a form in the meantime in hopes they will at least get the measly $750. \n\nThis whole thing is a joke and FEMA is hiding behind word play and even worse lies. I was in NC this past weekend dropping off supplies and I saw it for myself. I was helped with some very brave and amazing locals from the Greenville area to get my supplies to those who needed them. We all basically caravanned through backroads and trails to get the supplies their and avoid FEMA and the goons stopping people trying to help. It reminded me of the guerrilla type tactics I see freedom fighters employ on tv to help others in third world countries. \n\nAs one person there put around a camp fire one night “There is no conspiracy but there is also no one really in charge.

Opinion on Lindsay Graham?,"Recently, Senator Lindsay Graham had an interview where he decided to divert attention from the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene, and instead to redirect the attention to Israel.

Now Israels conducting one of the most controversial ""wars"" out there, but that's not what I wanna focus on. How do you, the people he's meant to represent, feel about Lindsay Graham, particularly regarding his Israel comments? Are you outraged that he's more focused on a foreign nation than addressing local problems, or are you used to politicians being bought off by Israel?",https://www.reddit.com/r/southcarolina/comments/1g3nt6z/opinion_on_lindsay_graham/,1728932639.0,tizzy20,southcarolina,"[{'Comment Author': 'salty-sheep-bah', 'Comment Body': ""I don't follow politics much.

They do not ask you softball questions. They all however treated me with complete respect even if I didn't immediately have the answer to their question.\n\nThen there was Lindsay Graham. Who treated me like I was fucking scum beneath his shoe. I am giving presentation I have given numerous times and he is audibly scoffing at me in front of everyone. I have never wanted to deck a mother fucker like I wanted to deck him.

If Bibi really just wanted peace, he\'d agree to the countless ceasefires that were proposed, all of which would\'ve resulted in an end to the bombings (Hezb said that it was firing rockets at Israel in solidarity with Gaza & that it\'ll stop if Israel leaves Gaza, whether u want to believe them is a different point). \n\nWhat im getting at is that Israeli government has been provoking all their neighbours for an all out war, and wants to drag the US into direct conflict with Iran. Even all the hostage families & many Israelis recognize that their government does not want peace. Many of Bibi\'s personal negotiators believe that he was sabotaging the ceasefire deals (that he\'d give them last minute changes that make it impossible for the other side to accept). Even his own defence minister Yoav Gallant was appalled at Bibi\'s choice to prioritize the philadelphy corridor over the hostages lives.\n\nIf Israel was launching a proper campaign to rid Gaza of Hamas, and was actually concerned for civilian life, then it wouldn\'t get half as much criticism as it does presently. The problem with Israels war strategy is that, it basically rains hell on whoever its attack & terrorizes the civilian population, hoping that they\'d turn against their leadership. Many Lebanese Christians that HATE Hezbollah, blame Israel, NOT because it wants to rid Lebanon of Hezbollah, but because Israel has devastated ALL of Lebanon & does not limit their targets to Hezbollah. \n\nThe IDF claims that it only targets infrastructure with militant activity, but there is  a lot of documented proof that suggest otherwise. There have been several UN workers, aid workers, UN peacekeeping troops and humanitarian organizations that have been targetted by the IDF. You cannot claim that you ""care about preserving human life"" while dropping 2000lb bombs on densely populated civilian areas. Even if we were to give Israel the benefit of the doubt and assume that it never intentionally targets civilians, is it okay to kill 100 civilians to catch 1 Hamas fighter? is it okay to level a functioning hospital if it houses some militants? all that is called collective punishment.\n\n  \nAnd this is if we were to assume that Israel is always saying the truth about militant activity in these facilities. Look up the ""Open Letter from U.S. Doctors to President Biden"". Its a letter written by 99 American doctors that served in Gaza, and the stories they describe are beyond atrocious. The doctors even state that they have never witnessed militant activity in hospitals that Israel targets. Why would American doctors lie on behalf of a foreign terrorist organization? So there\'s definitely foul play on the Israeli governments part. & this isn\'t even to mention the ""torture camps"" (Sde Teiman), the blocking of US aid or the settler violence & land grabs in the West Bank.\n\nIf we were to look at it from them Palestinians perspective, do you really expect them to look at Israel levelling Gaza, destroying more than 60% of the buildings there, killing indiscriminately, blocking food & aid, and conclude that this is all Hamas\' fault? All this isn\'t to defend Hamas. They too committed war crimes on Oct 7 & they invited all this mayhem against their people. My concern is that Israel seems to be blame ALL Palestinians for Hamas\' actions. Several Israeli politicians have come out with statements that insight violence against all Palestinians or collectively blame Palestinians for the Oct 7 attacks. \n\nSo td;lr, I dont have a problem with Israel defending itself & its civilians, but what I do have a problem with is when Israel gets a carte blanch to conduct the war however it wants, and then frames it all as ""defending itself"". You know what, fck Israel, fck Hamas, fck Gaza, fck Hezbollah & fck Iran. What do you think of Bibi? Do you actually believe that all he\'s doing is just to protect the Israeli civilians? Do you think his ambitions aren\'t politically motivated? Do you think he\'s NOT prolonging the war to postpone trial for corruption charges?'}, {'Comment Author': 'tizzy20', 'Comment Body': 'Once again, im not attacking you or anything, but the truth is that western media always runs the Israeli narrative so everything is portrayed as ""Israel defending itself"" when more times than not, its doing some of the instigating itself.
