Here‚Äôs an overview of how they are connected:\n\n1. **Increased Frequency and Intensity**: Climate change, driven by rising greenhouse gas emissions, leads to warmer temperatures, which, in turn, can intensify weather patterns. This results in more frequent and severe heatwaves, droughts, heavy rainfall, and storms.\n\n2. **Rising Temperatures**: Higher global temperatures contribute to prolonged heatwaves and increased evaporation rates, which can exacerbate drought conditions. Warmer air can also hold more moisture, leading to intense rainfall and flooding.\n\n3. **Changing Storm Patterns**: Warmer ocean temperatures provide more energy for hurricanes and typhoons, making them more powerful. These storms are also now occurring in places that were previously less affected, altering traditional weather patterns.\n\n4. **Melting Ice and Rising Sea Levels**: The melting of polar ice caps and glaciers due to higher temperatures contributes to rising sea levels, which can lead to coastal flooding, especially during storms.\n\n5. **Shifting Weather Systems**: Climate change disrupts traditional weather patterns, altering the behavior of jet streams and other large-scale atmospheric systems. This can lead to unusual weather, such as unexpected cold snaps or persistent weather patterns that exacerbate extreme events.\n\nIn summary, while individual weather events cannot always be directly attributed to climate change, the overall trend shows that a warming planet is making extreme weather more common and more severe, posing significant risks to ecosystems, economies, and human societies.'}, {'Comment Author': 'Honest_Cynic', 'Comment Body': ""Measured on land?

First, the area experienced significant rain prior to Helene.

Will Florida be completely unlivable/destroyed in the next few years?,"I‚Äôve been thinking about this for the past several days. Helene did a number on Florida and a few other states, but now they‚Äôre saying that Milton will be worse. A meteorologist teared up because it‚Äôs such a horrifically strong hurricane. At what point will Florida just be too dangerous to live in? The state isn‚Äôt landlocked, it‚Äôs extremely vulnerable to tropical storms, hurricanes, and tsunamis(if they happen to get a tsunami). At this point, every few months a hurricane that requires evacuation hits Florida and I‚Äôm not even sure it‚Äôs worth living there now that weather seems to be getting worse. I get it, Florida has survived many many hurricanes probably since the North American continent formed, but it‚Äôs still concerning considering that climate change is getting worse every year and Florida might be completely underwater soon. It‚Äôs scary to think about, isn‚Äôt it? I just know that I‚Äôd already be moving out of there if I lived there.

Ocean Temperature Data Offline,"Many of us in-the-know, consider ocean temperature the best long-term indicator of the planet's energy imbalance, so refer to data on this site.

[https://climatereanalyzer.org/clim/sst\_daily/?dm\_id=world2](https://climatereanalyzer.org/clim/sst_daily/?dm_id=world2)

Notice that the data comes from a federal office in Asheville, NC, so hasn't updated since Sep 27:

*""The OISST data on this page are sourced from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) data center located in Asheville, North Carolina, one of many communities severely impacted by*¬†[*heavy rainfall and historic flooding*](https://climate.ncsu.edu/blog/2024/09/rapid-reaction-historic-flooding-follows-helene-in-western-nc/)¬†*associated with Hurricane Helene. The NCEI data center has been offline since September 27th, and it is uncertain when service can be restored.""*

Data averaged over all ocean depths, rather than just surface temperature, would be even a better metric, but I haven't found a site for that.  Surface temperature is easier since can be measured globally by satellites.  There are buoys which descend to depths then rise to transmit their data, since the early 2000's.

This Euro site is still updating.  The plotted data is a bit different than the U of Maine site, though both are for the same region (+/-60 deg from equator).  It hasn't yet shown temperatures exceeding 2023 for current date, though ReAnalyzer did on Sep 25.
