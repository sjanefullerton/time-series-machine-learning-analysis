FEMA assistance rundown,"So here is a run down of how applying for assistance has gone for me so far. 

I applied for assistance on 10/11 over the phone. 
After a few days I noticed a correspondence needed section on my application. 
On 10/23 I sent in documents online
On 10/25 I received a text and a call from an inspector finally scheduling an appointment to inspect damage to my home. 
On 10/24 he came. He said he would turn in the info and i would receive an email from him.
On 10/25 my application updated to inspection completed. But, assistance still pending. And I did NOT receive an email from him like stated….

How long after actual inspection has everyone else received their funds? Mine will be a paper check IF my application even updates to say approved.

If you just need to vent,"So, I live in Hendersonville, North Carolina and we got hit pretty hard here. I know so many people had it so much worse than we did. I have heard a lot of people say the same thing. There is a lot of guilty feelings for being upset about not having Internet or service, having to boil water, having to restock fridges and freezers because of power outages. Then this is often followed up with, ""but others had it so much worse."" I do the same thing, but just know that your trauma is valid. How you feel right now is valid, and you're not alone. 

I am not physically capable of assisting those in need due to health issues. I have also donated financially as much as possible. So now I want to pay it forward as much as I can and I want to be here to listen. 

I have created a Gmail account to receive emails from anyone who just needs to vent about what is happening right now. Please feel free to email me any time. I want to be your sounding board.

Need Advice - Mold from Hurricane Aftermath ,"I just got back from evacuating my apartment in St Pete a week ago and noticed water damage on my ceiling and a strong moldy smell in the building. Turns out my next door neighbors have even more severe water damage on their ceilings and the entire top floor has moved out (20 units in 3 story building, I’m on the second floor and beneath is commercial) I’ve had a sore throat and cough since. I’ve noticed mold starting to grow on my things (shoes and books) I submitted a report, someone came to look while I was at work and closed the report claiming they didn’t see mold. Where do I go from here? I’m sure I need to leave asap but how do I go about this? Do I need to pay rent on the first? 
Can I get my deposit back?
All of my shoes are completely covered in mold, is there a way to fix them or do I need to throw them all away? 
The thing is I just moved to Florida (from VA) on Aug 1st and had to leave my first apartment due to a roach infestation, throw away all my furniture, move everything else into storage while I found this place, moved in at the end of August and bought new furniture, and didn’t start working until this week because the hurricanes pushed back my start date. With all of that, all my savings to move here are gone. I can’t afford to move again. If I have to move again I think I should move back to VA because I’m taking this all as a sign I don’t belong in FL.
FEMA can’t verify my identity and when I’ve called I’ve been on hold for 5 hours. 
I know others have lost everything due to this hurricane so this might be small in comparison but are there other resources?
I’ve been a nanny for 5 years so I’m looking all over the east coast for Live in Nanny positions because I have no clue what else to do. 
What do I do??

Do we need to continue to hold on to the unoperable vehicle? FEMA vehicle application is pending.,"A close family member lost everything in Helene, including a vechile. The other portion of their FEMA application have been mostly sorted out, with the exception of the vehicle assistance, which FEMA requested more information/documents on. All of the requested info has been provided at this point and it pending review and approval/denial. 

  
In the mean time - **do we need to continue to store the car?** If FEMA *does* approve assistance with the vehcile, will they want to take/remove the car themselves? The only similar scenario I can compare this to is if you total a car, and your insurance pays you for it, they take the car. 

The car cannot continue to sit at the property (was a rental, LL needs the car removed) and any storage facility we've spoken to will not allow an inoperable car to be stored on their property. 

We'd like to just have a junker haul the car away but do not want to do that if FEMA will want to take possession of the car, should they approve assistance.

He founded Zillicoah Beer Company, located two miles northwest of downtown Asheville in Woodfin, North Carolina, with his brother, Jeremy Chassner, and partner Jonathan Parks in 2017. The three built much of it themselves, cutting concrete and finishing bathrooms. The work then turned to brewing beer, primarily lagers, on a relatively low-tech, hands-on system. The trio preferred it this way.\n\nChassner remembers precisely which beers were in his steel tanks when the storm hit: 465 gallons each of an applewood-smoked helles and a light, vibrant kellerpils. On Sept. 26, gallons and gallons of those beers merged with the same raging floodwaters that mangled the brewery’s fences and swept away its entire interior. Asheville’s water — coveted for its pristine, soft qualities — was the lifeblood of its celebrated brewing scene. With Helene, it became something Chassner could not have imagined: a destructive force. Two days later, when he was finally able to survey the damage from a high point 300 yards from the brewery, he struggled to recognize the scene in front of him.\n\n“I thought, this is unbelievable,” he said. “I am in disbelief.

FEMA Question,"My Dad is the legal homeowner of the house that my family of 4 and I lived in until the recent hurricane hit. When Helene came we had several huge trees fall on our house that literally split our home in half and near about killed us. The home is a total loss. My Dad built the home in the 80's. He did not have insurance. I have applied for assistance from FEMA as a renter, even though I didn't really rent it because I didn't make a monthly payment or anything. 

So my question is, could I change my application to the owner of the home? From what I've read my Dad couldn't apply because it's not his main address. Surely there is some way to file to receive more assistance like a homeowner would receive. Any advice or knowledge anyone would like to share is much appreciated.

If the owner of the home has a different permanent and primary residential address, that home would not be eligible for federal disaster assistance, including help from volunteers, FEMA, and HUD.\n\nLook up Hurricane Sandy lawsuits, where people attempted to outsmart federal auditors by listing beach houses as the primary residence for one spouse and another home for the other spouse.

Depending on your governor\'s team, they may grant full rental payment for up to 32 months.\n\nAfter that, the repairs to the hurricane-damaged home would be the responsibility of your father or the owner.\n\nIn Louisiana, many families don\'t legally transfer ownership of the family home to the next generation, which creates serious eligibility issues.\n\nFrom my experience, you\'ll need to clean up the damage, get occupancy in part of the home to establish it as a permanent residence, and then focus on financing the repairs.\n\nAlthough I don\'t like SBA loans, the owner may need to explore the SBA program.\n\nYou\'re likely to get more ""I buy homes"" offers than you ever imagined.

Each County manages maps identifying evacuation areas (at least in Florida). Each County issues evacuation orders for evacuation zones for various storm events.

"Those who know, know. The aftermath of dealing / recovering from natural disasters. venting ","Just need vent 



If you've never been in a natural disaster, it is so much worse than what people can imagine from afar. The natural disasters such as hurricanes and storms from a hurricane is just as bad as you can imagine. But then, there's the whole aftermath of dealing with everything afterwards... And there are levels to how well or how difficult dealing with everything is based on where you were located in the natural disaster and your situation in life before the disaster versus afterwards.

Lost jobs 

Lost homes

Those who are disabled 

Those who became disabled (even temporarily) from the disaster 

Senior citizens, families, pet owners, livestock 


Stress, anxiety, body pain, hopelessness, survivor's guilt, not being able to volunteer because of your physical disabilities guilt, guilt from taking donations from individuals and having to wait in line for basic life necessities. Being homeless before the natural disaster affected by the natural disaster and being shunned by people because you were homeless before the natural disaster and they don't think you're worthy of any help because you were homeless before the natural disaster. 

F√CK!

😵

If you don't have an abundance of cash? You were just screwed for the first week or two. Your only ability to get food and water was food banks and relief centers. Gas? Cash only and only $20 worth in long lines


I have had tell different businesses/ corporation customer service support departments, multiple times ( 4+ times) that I cannot give them the documentation they want because of the natural disaster, and it would take weeks to get a replacement or I can't get the replacement from them because they want documentation that I don't have and can't provide.


 Assurance mobile actually told me I would have to have my name as a owner on the hotel (or the utility bill ) to prove I was here and it was my ""residence "" Paris Hilton can't even do that for the Hilton hotels. The hotel I am in is paid by FEMA, so my name is not on the hotel room bill. Thankfully, the supervisor understood the situation and made me a room invoice. Having a damaged phone or just losing your phone SUCKS - {🤖 increased stress levels by 20%}

Assurance calls me back today and says hi. We got your email. We got a proof of address and we just need to confirm your proof of address. Did you send that email with the attachment of proof of address? 

Me: 🤨

Proof of address has the name of the hotel and my name but you don't see the room number I'm in on the ""bill"". Assurance tells me they can't mail it out to a room number if it doesn't show on the invoice. So she says she either has to send it just to the address without the room number or she can't send it. 🤨

- {🤖 stress tolerance levels down by 40%} 


PostScan Mail (HIGHLY DON'T RECOMMEND THEM) 
Their customer service lead kept asking me for documentation I had told her multiple times was destroyed and cannot be replaced for several weeks. By the time she finally agreed to accept my driver's license, it was expired and so she said she wouldn't accept it because it was expired.  😡 I started the process 3 weeks before my driver's license was expired and needed to order a renewal. Thankfully my renewal driver's license is on the way now.


Medical? Even basic stuff is a hassle and unfortunately you're important is downgraded because of  emergencies happening for miles and miles around due to the hurricane or storm.

FEMA process - they've been the most flexible in working with me. 

SSI Disability - Way understaffed and way overworked due to the storm and there is months of delay

Replacing items 

Amazon deliveries just started about a week or two ago to the affected areas. Is Asheville even getting them yet? 
TEMU? 😡 You have to delete the default or temporary mailbox address so they don't change the address on you once you're in a hotel paid by FEMA and even then they may still change it!  😵. I ordered one box to go to a mailbox business that volunteer their address to receive replacement documentation and stuff. Week later, ordered more stuff to go to the hotel that I'm in. I chose the hotel address and because the order is coming in seven different boxes, they automatically change the address to the temporary.... That's 30 minutes away. 

Businesses - no longer in business or they can't open because they don't have access to water or it's too costly to run their business just on transported water 

Thieves/Scams - You really got to be an amoeba without any kind of a soul/ conscience to take advantage of people in the worst moment of their life. 


AND 

If you're staying at a hotel room that's being paid by FEMA, with a dog, the absolute least you can do is pick up your dog's shit AND don't allow him or her to shit by the water tanks/well.... Do you want to drink, clean and or bathe in water that could be contaminated with dog shit? I sure as fuck don't


The few people that help you in any way gives you hope. The hug from someone who's going through the same as you but they're doing just a teeny bit better or they're just dealing with it better. Seeing people come from other states to help out, giving out gift cards, seasonal clothing, a place to stay, free services ect... Those really are the only things that keep people going.

They started organizing the piles of diapers, boxes of canned food and mounds of winter clothes. But as soon as Yoxall, a retired Army nurse, and Arthur got to talking, and he started telling her about his work fighting cartels at the border, about his need for armed security, she got a bad feeling.\n\n“There’s something wrong here,” she told another longtime resident and fellow organizer.\n\nWhat she and others didn’t know yet was that Veterans on Patrol is an anti-government group steeped in conspiracy theories and that its leader has a well-documented history of embedding in communities to launch missions related to migrants or purported child trafficking, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Western States Center, two watchdog groups.\n\nRead more here: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/10/23/how-conspiracy-fueled-militia-got-foothold-this-hurricane-battered-town/?utm\\_campaign=wp\\_main&utm\\_medium=social&utm\\_source=reddit.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/10/23/how-conspiracy-fueled-militia-got-foothold-this-hurricane-battered-town/?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit.com)'}, {'Comment Author': 'Starrwulfe', 'Comment Body': 'What in the actual dystopian apocalyptic summer blockbuster is happening over there?!'}, {'Comment Author': 'DickieIam', 'Comment Body': 'It’s just all grifters….'}, {'Comment Author': 'Referralsforcrack', 'Comment Body': 'Nope.

A contract does not need to be written, in most cases a verbal agreement is a valid contract. \n\nThis will likely fall into lawyer/small claims territory. \n\nYou need to get your parents to document all facts that they know asap. Write an email describing every detail you know, and send that email to yourselves so there’s a time stamp on it.  Document things like: any pics of before and after, description of how much junk there was, how many trucks they used, how many people were out there working, any tools/machines they were using. Also document the entire recollection your parents have of every thing they discussed with the contractors.\n\nThe sooner you document this stuff, the better. You want to make sure to have a time stamp on it - that’s why I suggest email.\n\nFrom there - you need to call an attorney. It will likely cost around $300-$400 for a consultation.

Help for Swannanoa Business,"I’m reaching out on behalf of Liquid Design Paint and Collision, in Swannanoa, North Carolina, a family owned small business that was severely damaged by Hurricane Helene. The storm caused extensive damage to their facility, equipment, and inventory, forcing them to pause operations and threatening both the family and their small business.

This business has been serving Swannanoa and Asheville North Carolina surrounding communities for years with top-quality paint and collision repair services. With the challenges that they're facing, they're now asking for your help to rebuild. Specifically, seeking support for:

Facility repairs  
Replacing damaged equipment  
Restocking essential inventory

They've created a GoFundMe Site -[https://gofund.me/3795244a](https://gofund.me/3795244a) , and would love to be considered for assistance. Any assistance you can provide would make a huge difference in helping them get back on our feet and continue serving the community. We’d be deeply grateful for your consideration.

We had to evacuate the day after the storm due to being unaware that any help was on the way and panicking because I was out of formula for her, and had no physical cash, only tap pay, so being in an area where the storm did so much damage none of the few stores that were open were taking anything but cash at the time. We were also left without water and power as a result of the storm. We evacuated to another part of NC that was not impacted by the hurricane however expenses incurred during that time have left a huge financial strain. I’m working diligently to cover the gaps, if you guys would please share our GoFundMe we’d so much appreciate it. Hope everyone is safe and doing well.

#FloridaHurricaneIssue,"Hello,

I bought a home 3 months ago that was advertised by the real estate broker, seller, inspection company, appraiser, lender, insurance company as a 3 bed 1 bath. 

Come to find out now after the hurricane took all my belongings and walls have been peeled back it’s classified by the county as a 0 bed/1 bath. 


What legal recourse do I have? If any?

FEMA's new eligibility rules?,"I got denied benefits today for my basic needs. I have roof damage and water damage that ruined a lot of my kids clothes and diaper stash, my fridge broke from the power outage and surges and I lost food and other things. We are renters, homeowners insurance through our landlord is what's going to cover the roof, but from what I saw the VP say about the basic needs and what it said, we would qualify. 
In fact, I know a ton of people who did qualify who lost less! I mean we last two appliances, hundreds of dollars of clothes, diapers, food, back windshield to the car from tree branches, spent money we didn't have to replace and get basic needs etc. 

So I finally got through to a fema employee and he said the federal gov as of last week has new criteria that if the damages in your home were not ""bad enough to displace you,"" then you do not qualify for basic needs assistance ($750). No we didn't leave our house... Because we couldn't anyway! Also where would we have gone? But we lost so much! I'm so confused, what's happening? Anyone have any insight? 

To appeal, id need to get my landlord to prove that I lived here during the storm, that the damages are from the storm, a contractor receipt to see how much damages are THEN they still would probably deny us because our house is still livable? Does this sound right?

Edit: 
Well, just found out literally tonight that our entire backyard and deck is covered in black mold after our kids were outside and came in reeking of mold. Because of the flooding.

FEMA correction not showing," I applied for FEMA assistance and got an odd status. My status says that I didn't provide information on why I needed assistance. It turned out something went wrong when I was doing the app on a damaged phone and it made it look like I was NOT without power. 

I called and spoke to a rep about 5 days ago and she corrected the information on my registration for me. (I also uploaded identity verification documents as requested and relevant info) 

My main question: are the corrections that the rep made supposed to show up on my online file or are the corrections something that's only viewable internally by FEMA agents? (Because my online registration has not changed)

I wonder if it will be best for me to call back and have them withdraw it so I can redo it all together?

The people don\'t get the opportunity to pay the 25% cost share for assistance, that\'s all determined by the governors office of each state.\n\nIn Alaska, there is a tribe that has FEMA reimburse for hunting rifles, spears, traps and fishing equipment.

How do we just go on? ,"So, today is the first day I’ve been able to work in a week , and it was hard. Between having to foster our cats, emptying out the ‘home’ we’ve had for the past 2.5 years…throwing all of ours and our kids belongings in the trash. The list of everything we need to do just gets longer and longer between bills the don’t stop coming, having to find a new home, trying to change and shift my kids homeschool curriculum to do what we can for now and, trying like hell to just make it through another day. 

To say we are grateful for our community, jobs, friends and family giving and donating all they have would be an understatement. The love, delicacy , and patients we’ve been given through this is truly beautiful. 

However, we of course need money. We need to work. We have been jumping through the hoops with FEMA and any other organizations to help financially, we have a GoFundMe started. Now, it’s just sharing our GoFundMe, praying, praying and praying, waiting and working and saving all we possibly can in the mean time. My husband and I have held it together, honestly only as well as we have because of our kids.

I felt 100% ready to go to work ( I’m a waitress). The second I walked into work , I felt as if I’d been hit by a bus. I held it in my whole shift , then sat in the parking lot afterwards and bawled for 30 minutes or more. How am I supposed to just smile, maintain my normal upbeat - happy - positive attitude and,  talk to guests like I didn’t just lose my whole house and every single thing we own? My kids entire lives , safety and security? Their safe space. Their belongings. How do I do this? How do I just have a normal conversation and a normal shift like before? I  don’t wanna bring my guests dinning experience down or make them feel lm not paying enough attention to them or neglecting them, but I don’t  know how to separate it right now. How can I? My heart is hurting, i haven’t broke yet but I can feel myself breaking. I’m overwhelmed to my absolute maximum capacity. How do I manage working right now like nothing just happened?! 

Important side note: I have narcolepsy with cataplexy ( severe) and I’m SO exhausted, yet can’t sleep ( sleep and a healthy sleep schedule is BEYOND important with this disorder, so not sleeping is dangerous for my body and my mental stability). Can barely eat. Can barely think straight. Genuinely hard to keep track of what day it even is?

Among losing all of my physical belongings I also felt like I lost a version of myself, which is true because I’m not the same person that I was before that traumatic event. \n\nI’ll never forget finding an earring in the pocket of a pair of shorts the day after and breaking down sobbing because it was a piece of a life that was now forever in the past. \n\nI also work in customer service and reading your words on the invisible wounds we have when having to put on a smile for people at work really moved me. It’s like going through this very monotonous but important part of your life and feeling like something is wrong/missing and nobody you talk to understands because they can’t actually see your pain. And you’re at work so you literally can’t do anything about it because you have to perform. \n\nSomething that helped me was perspective. I had to flip it as “my best friend and our pets made it home safely”, and “we have a house where we feel safe”. \n\nI have no idea what it feels like to lose a home in a natural disaster but you have to find the base positives in this situation. You are okay, your kids are okay, you still have a job. You will be okay, it’s just going to take some time and a lot of tears and nights when it feel like it won’t be. \n\nYou’re already back at work and trying to get the ball rolling. Give yourself some grace, allow yourself to feel everything, and take it a day at a time.'}, {'Comment Author': 'Foreverforgettable', 'Comment Body': 'I haven’t been through what you are going through. I do however suffer from depression, anxiety, depersonalization disorder and have had insomnia my whole life. The only advice I can give is to try NOT to look at the bigger picture, at least for a little bit. Tackle one task at a time, literally. Set one particular task as a goal and when you accomplish it give yourself a pat on the back and allow yourself to be proud you accomplished it. Even if it’s a minuscule task. It is a task you finished and it is worthy of acknowledgement. \n\nI know you likely have good reasons for homeschooling your children. See if it’s possible to use online resources to supplement what you would normally do or even push back some of what you would normally do to weekends/holidays. Your children may not like it but will be grateful for your efforts when they are old enough to understand. \n\nWhile I understand you have to try to be positive within your field of work, you are also human and I’m sure the guests you work with are aware of the events that have happened in your area. You are human and do not have to be “on” all of the time. If possible to take a minute, literally a minute, every so often to breathe at work try to do so. I know work can be stressful and chaotic and time free is not really existent (I work in a hospital) but a minute to breathe in and out slowly to just gather yourself can make a huge impact on how your time goes. It can slow your heart rate down and help you feel more relaxed even when you’ve only take a minute to do so.\n\nReach out to any charities (online if need be) even if they’re not local to see if it is possible to get clothing and toys donated for your children. It’s very likely there are people/organizations that want to help but don’t know how they can.\n\nAs difficult as it may be, remember to try to prioritize yourself. I know your children are your first priority but parents often forget they are no good to anyone if they are not healthy themselves. Self care is in a way caring for your children because you are working towards making sure they have a healthy and present parent. It is ok to make yourself a priority when you can.\n\nDo not think about the next weeks/months. Think of the next few hours up to the next day. It is easier to plan for that type of time period when you are faced with chaos around you. One step at a time verse 15 million that have to happen to reach the ultimate goal. Normal won’t be possible for a while but small victories can be. You can do this.'}, {'Comment Author': 'Janiebug1950', 'Comment Body': 'You don’t have to act like nothing has happened… 99% of people coming in for a meal or afternoon coffee know what has happened post Helene and Milton.

Hurricane Helene Aftermath,"Hey everyone,



As we wrestle with the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on the devastating events we've been faced with and discuss how we can support one another during this challenging time.

Hurricane Helene landed onto Florida with remarkable intensity, leaving lots of people homeless and with their property destroyed. Many of us have witnessed the chaos seeing homes destroyed, families displaced, and entire neighborhoods flooded. It’s difficult to understand the extent of the damage and the toll that it has taken on their community. For those who have lost loved ones or seen their homes reduced to nothing, my heart goes out to you.

In the days following the hurricane, it has been inspiring to see the outpouring of support from neighbors and strangers alike. Many have come together to help those in need by sharing food, providing shelter, and offering resources. This spirit of resilience and compassion truly defines our community. Let’s keep that momentum going as we move forward.

If you’re looking for ways to help, numerous local organizations and shelters are accepting donations of food, clothing, and supplies. Even small contributions can make a significant difference in someone’s life. Additionally, volunteering your time can be incredibly rewarding; there are many opportunities to assist with cleanup efforts or support local recovery initiatives.

It's also vital to recognize the importance of mental health during times like these. The trauma from such events can linger long after the physical damage has been repaired. If you or someone you know is struggling, please reach out for help. Many local mental health services are now offering support specifically for hurricane survivors.

As we begin to rebuild, let’s ensure we’re not just restoring what was lost but also strengthening our community ties. This experience can serve as a catalyst for creating better emergency plans and improving our infrastructure for the future. It’s an opportunity for growth, learning, and solidarity.

Lastly, I encourage everyone to share your stories and experiences within this community. Whether it’s a tale of survival, a moment of kindness you witnessed, or the challenges you’re facing, your voice matters. Let’s keep this conversation going, support one another, and emerge from this stronger than ever.

Stay safe, and take care of each other. We’ll get through this together.

Advice Needed About Damage/Repairs,"Hi All! My in-laws have spent winters in Port Richey (north of Tampa) for the last 20 or so years. They have a trailer (free standing) in a park just north near the water. They had pretty awful flooding from Helene. Sounds like about 4+ feet of water. Due to some medical appointments, they haven't been able to get down there yet and won't be there for another week or two. My FIL (80) thinks he can get the whole place back into shape in about 3 days (he has good carpentry skills) and they can stay there until May. The rest of us think that's crazy. They also heard many of their neighbors are selling their places for $1 and walking. We want to help prepare them and determine next steps realistically. 

So here's the question: Assuming (based on neighbor reports) that the water was up to 3' indoors, what are they returning to? Their place is shut up tight and hasn't been opened since the flooding. Guessing mold everywhere? And that they'll need to replace flooring, lower cabinetry, furniture, appliances, etc? Assuming since others are in this position it will be challenging to get supplies? They aren't eligible for FEMA assistance due to only being half-year residents. Thank you for any information or opinions you can offer.

Communication etiquette with survivors ,"If people you know and love survived Helene and incurred property damage or loss, lost friends or loved ones, are still without power, water or both, lost their business, lost their jobs, please take my advice.

What not to do:

- Make jokes. You may not know what to say and feel inclined to lighten the mood, but there is nothing funny about this situation for anyone on the ground. There will be a time for leveraging humor to heal, but that time is not now. Making jokes about “practicing being a pioneer” is insulting to the strain it takes to survive without these vital services while simultaneously cleaning up our homes and businesses, staying warm, and making sure we have warm meals.

- Ask stupid questions like, “What are you doing for water? How are you flushing your toilet? How much money have you gotten from FEMA?” 

- Send disinformation about FEMA. FEMA is all over the place. People are receiving funds, and the agency is doing the best they can to reach everyone. It takes time and an extraordinary amount of organization and logistics to make this happen. These lies are neither true nor helpful. 

- Ask to send things like dry goods. We have an abundance of dry goods. If you want to send something, send money. Even $25 helps. Even with free meals, free gas, free clothing, free supplies, the expenses add up fast, and many have not been able to work since things are at a standstill here and all hands are on deck to feed us, rescue those still in need, and get our utilities back up and running. We spent $175 on the two extension cords we needed for our generator. This is just one of the many unexpected costs that come with reacting to a disaster like this. 

- Continue to ask us how we are, or call to chat. We are drained, emotionally and physically. We are tired. We don’t even know how we are and it changes moment to moment, day to day. We don’t have time to chit chat and we don’t have the energy to placate you. 

- Send random donations without checking with local groups first. We have been inundated with donations, which you would have to see to believe. Many distribution hubs don’t have enough volunteers or space to manage it all. And there are still smaller, more rural areas that need these items. Needs are shifting to clean up efforts, and vary based upon the community in need.

What to do instead:

- Practice empathy. Just look at the images on the news and listen to the stories of loss and ask yourself how you would want someone to communicative with you. We just experienced a mass trauma that has left survivors, even those who didn’t lose anything or anyone, with PTSD. It’s a war zone. What was a peaceful string of communities has turned into a zone of wreckage. Helicopters continue to fly ahead at all hours of the day and night. Army trucks are everywhere you look, and in our town they are handing out food and supplies. Don’t ask us how we are, empathize with us. Empathy is trying your best to understand how someone feels and listening. Phrases like “I bet what you are going through is really hard. Please let me know if there’s any way I can support you.” Don’t go on about your recent vacation or your new car. Some of us are living a waking nightmare and that just adds insult to injury. 

- Send money to your friends & family. Even $25 helps. Most of us aren’t in a flood plain, and therefore weren’t eligible for flood insurance. Most who are may not have been able to afford it. We have a long, difficult, unknown, and costly road ahead of us. FEMA will help bridge the gap of what was lost, but entire homes, trailers, businesses are gone or will need to be demolished. People have to start all over. Start donating to every GoFundMe you see. Search other threads for reputable local organizations and nonprofits who are on the ground and send them $5, $25, $50 if you can. We will need as much financial support as we can get, and we need it now. 

- Offer help researching companies, repairs, equipment, or anything we are going to need to rebuild. Many don’t have internet, and a lot don’t have power. There is so much to think about and it’s difficult to prioritize or know where to start. This can be a huge help in many situations.

Source: Only child of an elderly retired teacher who just lost half of her home that we’ve both invested heavily in, in Black Mountain. I lived here during COVID and spend about 1/3 of my time here. I’ve been here for 11 days now. We just got power back last night but still have no water. I hope everyone out there is doing what they need to do, and feeling what they need to feel.

THIS!!!! We are living on nothing but auto-pilot, and survival mode. I’m tired of phone calls and texts that I have to reply to , or my silence gets taken as being rude? While trying to figure everything out , cleaning out our house ( ours, and our 3 children’s belongings and entire lives tossed in a dumpster) I have been talked down to, and degraded , called a scammer for starting a gofund me ( specifically in this sub )and asking for help…because we haven’t worked in 2 weeks, bills keep  coming and I am trying to just keep my head above water and asking for help to rebuild our everything lost that took YEARS to build in the first place! Our list of things to do and , phone calls to make gets longer every single day. We’re trying to foster our kitties because we can’t keep them where we stay, on top of all else. It has been SO MUCH! We have water, we have food, toiletries and are okay in supplies right now ( thank the good lord for that) , and I’m positive we will need more supplies soon , we have received donations and people offering to assist with furniture and clothes , and we are so beyond grateful for this and our friends, family and community for being so generous, loving and kind! We need a whole new house, help with our bills and just trying to save any dollar we can to keep up and at the same time replace all my family of 5 lost , and that requires money and a gofund me! \n\nSo whole heartedly THANK YOU FOR THIS. My husband and I have worked so so so hard for everything we’ve provided to and for our family and, throwing it all away has been absolutely gut wrenching! \n\nAlso:, could you maybe add to this list of ‘don’t do’ to include…\n\ndo not minimize peoples loss and tell them “ it’s just stuff, we’re grateful you’re alive. It’s all replaceable, just be grateful you’re alive”.

We can’t. We have elderly family here. We have a support system WE have built here which consists of friends and co-workers who have constantly offered every ounce of effort, time, and resources they can to show up for us! Not just call from our of state and berate us with expectations of how we should be handing this. Please don’t do that! \n\nThen the never ending question of “ what’s your game plan?”. We don’t know. We can’t even think straight or keep up, don’t even know what day of the week it is. It’s been 2 weeks? I think? I really don’t even know right now.

WNC Helene Supplies Network Discord Server,"WE INVITE YOU TO JOIN:

the **WNC Helene Supplies Network Discord Server**!

Join here: [https://discord.gg/FakfAJdyAX](https://discord.gg/FakfAJdyAX)

We are a Collaborative Distribution & Delivery Network focused on supporting the urgent and basic needs of WNC communities that are particularly vulnerable due to limited transportation, access, age, ability, etc. \*\*People who need supplies *DELIVERED TO THEM*\*\*

WE ARE:  folks on the ground, community leaders, non-profit organizations, churches, emergency departments, … all folks who are working to move supplies on hand to folks in housing communities that cannot access hubs and communities in remote areas that need supplies delivered.

The ***WNC Helene Supplies Network Discord Server***

Is organized by REGION and by NEIGHBORHOODS that are participating. This will (hopefully) help to focus efforts and increase efficiency. (Specific neighborhoods will be added as they join)

We aim to consolidate communications around the movement of supplies to get the network of the many supply hubs and volunteers to transport on the same page. We want to CONNECT and not command. It’s a place to communicate and organize! There has been a quick response to get supplies here, and there is an emergent need to streamline the flow and communication to best serve on all ends of the process.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

IN PHASE TWO: …is coming soon!!

We are partnering with WNC Response and Recovery who will host and manage a workflow system. On their site, there will be a central “airtable” to organize requests for supplies and fulfillment. All requests will come with “Name, Address, Title of task” so that no task can be duplicated and given to more than one group for completion. Status of the process and other details will help increase efficiency and reduce redundancy.

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to join! All communication groups and threads (groups on FB, telegram, discord, etc)  will be invited to join the network around the WNC Response and Recovery airtable.

We hope this magnifies our efforts and the impact we can make together in WNC.",https://www.reddit.com/r/HurricaneHelene/comments/1g1k4u7/wnc_helene_supplies_network_discord_server/,1728680825.0,Dani-Hanna,HurricaneHelene,"[{'Comment Author': 'Character_Guava_5299', 'Comment Body': 'The invite is not working.'}, {'Comment Author': 'Dani-Hanna', 'Comment Body': 'I think it expired, I updated it now'}]"
Haven’t heard anything from FEMA…,"Hi everyone, I wonder if anyone has the same situation. 

I applied for FEMA assistance on 9/30 but it’s been over 11 days and they haven’t reach out to me regarding the files that I claimed (property, vehicle, house damage, medical,…). No voicemail, no phone call from them. I got texts but it just the system saying login to the website and stuffs. I even checked all the strange numbers, junk mails and my application status but it still said ‘Pending status’. 

Anytime I tried calling them (through the 3362 number), I had to wait more than an hour on hold just to disconnect and call again, yet no one answered. 
My house has been flooded so bad ( about 3ft of water inside) and I have to throw everything away, including furnitures, foods and my cars. I thought the process would be quick cuz I don’t have any house insurance but I haven’t heard anything since then. There was also no power for about a week. 

Any tips for quicker Fema process? I’m so desperate rn😭

Edited 1: Someone just said that this might be seen as a criticism against FEMA. If you are government seeing this, please spare me I didn’t mean to criticize anybody. I genuinely want to ask for advice and see if anyone in the same situation. I’m sorry if it offended anybody. 

Edited 2: I did receive $750 8 days after I applied and I thought everyone got the same as long as you submitted the application. I’m sorry for not being clear for that. 

Edited 3: Ok, after reading some comments, I’m glad I’m not the only one waiting for more than 10 days, yipiee.

Coffee Shop Operations after the hurricane: Boil Water Notice,"Posting this in a few different places. I manage a FL cafe - the city was just hit by Helene and Milton and is now under a boil water notice. I’m from out of state so this is a first time scenario for me.

A LOT of shops are putting full confidence in their RO, reassuring guests they can safely accommodate. I don’t think this is enough….

We have RO filtration but it is not connected to our ice machine. So I’m thinking we need:
- bagged ice or no iced drinks. Turning the ice machine off so it does not continue to run with contaminated water.
- a carafe of RO water for employees to wash hands safely for food preparation
- to adjust the settings of our drip and espresso boilers to heat to 212°. They currently do not, and most coffee shops do not heat their water to boiling enough for notices like this.
- we do manual pour overs, so I would want staff to boil RO water to 212° for a minute, let cool, and then brew with that water.
- our dishwasher is already at 212°, so as long as staff is aware it needs to reach that temp I think we would be ok. But I would rather run with an “everything to-go only” scenario. 
- to boil water for cleaning the floor EOD
- the water line is currently turned off so it doesn’t refill. But we WILL run out of water because the tanks are small.
- once the notice is lifted, I am assuming we will need to purge the RO tanks completely and reassess/replace filters. 

Thoughts? Anyone dealt with restaurant or coffee shop management during this and stayed open?",https://www.reddit.com/r/HurricaneHelene/comments/1g1bw6j/coffee_shop_operations_after_the_hurricane_boil/,1728659003.0,United_Brilliant_682,HurricaneHelene,[]

Northeast Tennessee Disaster Relief Center (Bristol Motor Speedway) Amazon Wishlist link,"Many counties in northeast Tennessee, from Sevier to Johnson, have been devastated by Helen. Homes, businesses, in some places whole sections of towns obliterated or just gone. For many displaced families who have lost their homes and have nowhere to go, several campgrounds are taking in evacuees, but with the cold quickly upon us the situation is turning dire for them to have the appropriate attire, equipment, and basic necessities to stay warm. There are also innumerable amounts of persons in more remote areas that may be without power for some time, or additionally remain cut off due to destroyed bridges, roads and the earth beneath them.

Bristol Motor Speedway — a beloved destination for many a NASCAR fans, has repurposed its mission at this time as the acting Northeast Tennessee Disaster Relief Center, the main hub from which goods, supplies, volunteers and more are being dispersed into the broader community. They have posted an Amazon wishlist (linked) where you can see exactly what they need, what the priority of those items is, how much of what they require, and basically cherry pick for yourself what you would like to send/donate. While you don’t have to add any gift message, I personally chose to make mine as an “In Memory Of” which I wrote into that box.

I hope this is helpful! It can be confusing sometimes to know what you can do or how/who to donate to when you are outside of the area, so this list takes out all of the guess work to make it a more accessible process for everyone. Please please please feel free to share this post or share their Amazon wishlist with others, on your socials, or any place else that you think it would be appropriate.",https://www.amazon.com/registries/gl/guest-view/3OKR202AU25PG,1728608808.0,latebloomerftm,HurricaneHelene,[]

It’s the equivalent to the entire state of Massachusetts. It’s not that FEMA isn’t here, it’s that they aren’t (and can’t be) everywhere. \n\nWhen people are giving individual accounts of not having federal help they are not lying. They are also completely traumatized by losing everything they own, losing loved ones, not having basic needs met, seeing people die, and watching their communities be completely decimated. I think it is understandable and human nature to feel like any federal response (or lack there of) is going to be insufficient for that type of personal devastation.\n\nThe truth is we will not know how to grade the response until we are out of the weeds, people are accounted for, and the emotional shock has dampened.\n\nBut all I know is at this scale of tragedy, two things can simultaneously be right- FEMA is active and deploying resources and helping thousands, and thousands have received no direct federal help and have been in desperate conditions. Pretty reasonable (especially being largely cut off from communications) that there are competing narratives on federal response.'}, {'Comment Author': 'RequirementIll8141', 'Comment Body': 'Search this sub, Asheville, and Appalachia it’s so many posts from people who are there and they have help there local, state, and federal relief help is there just go read the posts\n\nAnd to note it’s not just FEMA y’all minimize relief and disaster recovery and response efforts by doing that. FEMA is not a first responder FEMA is a second responder \n\nIts task force teams EMAC and IMAC wise sent in to help these places for search and rescue, local EMTs, police, firefighters, national guard, coast guard, other states sent in their tasks forces to help, multiple nonprofit organizations, multiple volunteers, its other agencies there.

We have good insurance which made us whole so the FEMA money wasn't really needed. Honestly it should have gone to the tens of thousands of people who lost everything and had nothing - no jobs, no homes, not even tents and sleeping bags.\n\nWe had an almost $300,000 loss and I believe we got about $200 - $300 from FEMA. I'm sure they assessed our insurance coverage to determine what we received. I hope those in need got more.\n\nWhat FEMA ultimately did was provide funding for debris removal to the cities and counties. Without this money they would have been bankrupted. Unless you experience something like this you have no idea how much debris there is. There were mountains of trees stacked around the county. I'm not talking about a large pile, these were massive because about 80% of the county's trees were lost. And garbage, so many tons of garbage. The entire contents of our home were lost including furniture, electronics, clothing, carpet, etc. The ceilings collapsed and everything was covered in insulation. We paid for our own garbage removal and it cost us about $5000 which was covered by our insurance.\n\nSo FEMA does provide important funding and while you may not get adequate money directly from them, they will help the cities and counties in ways you may not be aware of.

Help trying to replace something extremely important to my (veteran) husband,"I need help! 

My husband is a veteran, he was deployed a few years back, and while he was on deployment, he got to meet some major UFC fighters and get their signatures and pictures with them. He has a few big storage boxes with all of his military stuff and keep sakes of things he wanted to hold onto forever.

Here comes the issue : We lost our home and everything in it. These boxes were destroyed , I was able to save his patches/ some parts of his uniforms..but nothing else. Not his books, papers, or This has all been a whirlwind and he’s struggling with his  PTSD , and the loss of all of his memorabilia from his deployment has been really hard.  Understandably upset. We’ve been emptying the house out and throwing things away, saving whatever we are capable to, and as we’re going through his military boxes and sorting…my husband just started bawling. It absolutely broke me. He’s not the man that just breaks, and in 7 years, I’ve only seen him cry a handful of times. 

Here’s where I need help: I don’t have social media, so I can’t contact these UFC fighters (Paige vanzant / Max Holloway )  to try to get something else signed by them , to replace what he lost. So , any and all ideas or help or people reaching out to them for us, so I can get these at least these replaced for him? This is all really hard as is and losing these pretty much irreplaceable things, and watching my person and rock just completely fall apart…was almost worse.

In no disaster should a community wait for the cavalry – that is, the federal government – to swoop in and make everything whole. Disaster policy isn’t designed to work that way. The federal government exists to support local efforts.

Pushing Back on Hurricane Helene Misinformation,"Since Hurricane Helene made landfall, there’s been an influx of misinformation being spread by former President Trump, Congressional Republicans, bad-faith actors, scam artists, and others. It’s wrong, dangerous, and must stop immediately.  
  
To address just a few:  
  
**1.** **Falsehood: FEMA will only provide $750 to disaster survivors to support their recovery**  
  
**Fact: No, $750 is what is immediately available to eligible survivors.** This is a type of assistance that you may be approved for soon after you apply, called Serious Needs Assistance. It is an upfront, flexible payment to help cover essential items like food, water, baby formula, breastfeeding supplies, medication and other emergency supplies.  
  
There are other forms of assistance that you may qualify for; Serious Needs Assistance is an initial payment you may receive while FEMA assesses your eligibility for additional funds.  
  
In addition, survivors may qualify for more FEMA and other Federal financial assistance, including to repair storm-related damage to homes and property, find a temporary place to stay, and receive compensation for lost crops and livestock.  
  
**2. Falsehood: Disaster relief funds were used on immigrants in the U.S. illegally.**  
  
**Fact: No money is being diverted from disaster response needs.** FEMA’s disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster efforts. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts.  
  
**3. Falsehood: FEMA is in the process of confiscating Helene survivor property.** If I apply for disaster assistance and my land is deemed unlivable, my property will be seized.  
  
**Fact:** **FEMA cannot seize your property or land.** Applying for disaster assistance does not grant FEMA or the federal government authority or ownership of your property or land.

Donald Trump falsely accuses President Biden of redirecting disaster funds, a budget maneuver Trump himself approved in 2019.\n   * Even though Trump was once president, he still appears to have little clue about the **appropriations** process. What’s even richer is that when he was president, he did exactly what he claims Biden did — take money from FEMA’s disaster fund to fund migrant programs at the southern border.\n   * Mayorkas emphasized there was plenty of money to deal with the current disaster. “We are meeting the moment,” he said, adding: “We have the immediate needs right now. On a continuing resolution, we have funds, but that is not a stable source of supply, if you will.”\n      * “FEMA has what it needs for immediate response and recovery efforts,” FEMA spokeswoman Jaclyn Rothenberg said on X. “As \\[FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell\\] said, she has the full authority to spend against the President’s budget, but we’re not out of hurricane season yet so we need to keep a close eye on it. We may need to go back into immediate needs funding and we will be watching it closely.”\n   * So how does Trump link this to migrants? A Trump campaign spokesman pointed to FEMA’s Shelter and Services Program, which gives grants to local governments and nonprofits to take care of undocumented immigrants. **Congress** boosted the budget from $360 million in fiscal year 2023 to $650 million in fiscal year 2024. The program’s 2023 annual report says it provides shelter, such as hotel/motel services, food and transportation, including plane tickets up to $700 a person.\n      * As we said, **Congress appropriated this money**, just as it did the disaster fund. There’s no evidence that any money from the disaster fund was used to help migrants.\n      * “These claims are completely false,” DHS said in a statement Thursday night. “As Secretary Mayorkas said, FEMA has the necessary resources to meet the immediate needs associated with Hurricane Helene and other disasters. The Shelter and Services Program (SSP) is a completely separate, appropriated grant program that was authorized and funded by Congress and is not associated in any way with FEMA’s disaster-related authorities or funding streams.”\n   * Trump has a habit of assuming other politicians act in the same way as he would. So we wondered why he would accuse Biden of raiding the FEMA disaster fund to handle undocumented migrants.\n      * It turns out that’s because he did this. In 2019, the Trump administration, in the middle of hurricane season, told Congress that it was taking $271 million from DHS programs, including $155 million from the disaster fund, to pay for immigration detention space and temporary hearing locations for asylum seekers who had been forced to wait in Mexico. “The U.S. is facing a security and humanitarian crisis on the Southern border,” the administration said in its notice that it was redirecting the funds.\n\n> [FEMA’s budget is measured](https://archive.ph/p1IHe) in billions, not millions. The Hurricane Helene recovery effort is expected to cost tens of billions of dollars. Any funding shortfall is not the result of spending a few hundred million already allocated to immigration, but Congress’ failure to significantly increase FEMA’s funding in a stopgap spending bill passed last week to avoid a government shutdown.'}, {'Comment Author': 'Lucky-Earther', 'Comment Body': '> Also, look at the fema website.

And his call for a nationwide campaign to detain and deport undocumented immigrants would cost $350 billion.\n      * Trump says major new tariffs on imports would bring in enough revenue to offset all the tax cuts, but the study doesn’t support that claim, and many economists say the tariffs would also drive prices up for U.S. consumers.\n      * [“Tariffs are just a tax, no question about it,” Stephen Moore,](https://archive.ph/B4Pzr) an economist at the right-wing Heritage Foundation and a Trump economic adviser, told policymakers at an event hosted by Politico this spring. “I don’t always agree on everything with Donald Trump. He knows I don’t agree with the monetary policy. A tariff is just a consumption tax.”\n   * Harris would add $3 trillion to the debt by extending the 2017 tax cuts for those earning less than $400,000 a year, and $1.35 trillion through a major expansion of the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit, according to the study. Harris’s campaign says those programs would cost far less.\n* [Donald Trump Tax Plans Would](https://archive.ph/mNCUJ) Increase Taxes On[ 95% Of Americans, Analysis Finds](https://archive.ph/xeQdV). The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found Trump’s tariff proposals would outweigh his tax cuts for all but the very richest households.\n   * “But his proposed tariffs, which would be largely passed onto consumers as increased prices, would more than offset those tax cuts for all income groups outside the richest 5 percent,” the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy said in an analysis it published on Monday. \n      * Taken together, the tax cuts and tariffs would cost households in the middle 20% of the income distribution an average of $1,530 in 2026, the analysis found, while the richest 1% would save $36,320. Only 5% of the wealthiest households would come out ahead under Trump’s plans. \n   * In a separate analysis on Monday, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said Trump’s tax plans could cost the government as much as $15 trillion, whereas the Harris campaign’s proposals could cost $8 trillion.\n\nImagine voting for the candidate incoherently pledging to reduce prices inexplicably by enacting 20%-200% tariffs (and he still doesn't understand that tariffs are duties directly paid by the importer at customs - indirectly the consumer), disallowing food imports, raising prices by deporting workers (an absurdly costly endeavor itself), and assuming control over the Fed to lower interest rates - which were raised pre-pandemic to counter the inflationary effects of his tax cuts, which he wants to further add to.""}, {'Comment Author': 'PR_Bella_Isla', 'Comment Body': 'Give it up.

Deficits add to the net disposable income of individuals, to the extent that government disbursements that constitute income to recipients exceed that abstracted from disposable income in taxes, fees, and other charges.

Hi, Folks. This might be of some use. I made a Google Map of affected areas with drop offs, distributions, road closures, etc. There is a lot of info floating around, but it's pictures and graphics, not really cloud tools. For people not from there, getting around can be a bit of a problem at the moment. This is to help you get there a little easier. Churches, schools, and volunteer fire departments are the goto on the ground for labor/physical help organization right now. Help gets turned away while other areas go unserved. It's part of the chaos on the ground there. Folks are driving for hours into an unknown and chaotic situation with not much how to get around or who to contact, relying on social media to find people and information. Daily social media just wasn't made for this and is rather unwieldy with scrolls, algorithms, and endless arguing. I lifted road data from TN DOT and a few FB groups to pin brick and mortar locations where things are happening to help others. Instead of culling manual data, spreadsheets would go a LONG way for generating these things faster.

The situations and logistics needs on both sides of the Smokies are very different. Manpower and resources from the East has a steeper climb. More isolated trouble spots are over the TN border in NC. The Blue Ridge Parkway no longer exists. The land basically jumped back to the 1700s with everything and everyone still on top of it. 300 years of hard labor to settle those mountains was just shook like a snowglobe. It is an area the size of Belgium. Roads are being repaired as fast as possible, while some don't even exist anymore. Some roads haven't even been reached yet to be tagged. Others were flagged and then fixed within a day or two. I see the TN DOT maps creeping upwards into the hills daily. There are new dark and remote areas only accessable by 4x4. You've all seen the mules, too. Same idea. Some spots will be closed for a month. Others will need years to rebuild. They're still trying to reach remote areas with supplies.

Food locations are opening up rapidly, too. I'll mark those. Folks go up there and cook and run shifts in kitchens while others run medications and supplies like an offroading Doordash. Emergency response has the data they need, but people travelling from outside the area don't really have handy tools for communication. Starlink is just part of the puzzle.

There is a lot of info and static graphics, but few web and cloud tools available. Please, geeks, think about making some USEFUL cloud things that volunteers can easily reach. My local AI group is having a brainstorm session tomorrow. I'm also brainstorming longer-term ecological remediation like mushrooms for ecological cleanup, hemp seeds for river bank stability ($30k for 1,00lbs, 25million seeds) and yard birds good for eggs and bug/tick control (guinea hens and chickens $2-3 apiece. Ducks/geese don't really fit.)

They currently have plenty of ""stuff"" to be distributed in NC and TN, but need abled and even partially abled bodies. It is quickly becoming apparent for the need for PPE gear when helping out with cleanup, like knee high boots, SN95 respirators + filters, and gloves. I, too, hated masks with Covid, but they're a really good idea up there with the sludge and dust and mold.

Keep in mind this is still very steep and rolling terrain. It's not the Rockies, but it's still very hilly with several hundred feet of elevation change required to get down over and up to the next hill. All of that infrastructure washed downstream in a day.

  
Still unreached areas as of 10/8.

This is a very wealthy town in CA. This fire burned the way a tornado moves. Its unheard of. If CalFire knew this was on the map everyone would have been evacuated. NO ONE would be standing on this beach watching their house burn down. The only reason we’re in a parking lot is because there’s only one way in and one way out of this city and by the time we needed to evacuate the fire was already in front of us. I didn’t own a house here I rented maids quarters but for example there is more live stock in this place than you can imagine. The people who do know how to move up and out swiftly and safely with families pets and live stock. They’re prepared. If CalFire knew this beast was blazing they would have stopped it before it even hit civilization. This city DID NOT have FIRE HYDRANTS. Sometimes saying “they would have done this” or “the city will do this” or “we should this” or “ we should wait for this that or the other thing” isn’t at all what you should do. Sometime you have to get a PO Box or borrows someones mailing address while you live in your car, or on the ground wrapped in garbage bags under your clothes to stay warm breathing through one overwhelming moment after the next, one sleepless night at a time.\n\nThis is all considered normal during natural disasters nowadays. Helene isn’t the first unfortunately.'}]"

"Recovering your family heirlooms, valuables, and vital documents","Hey friends, book and paper conservator here.

We want you to know, there's an entire community of conservators who are standing ready to assist organizations, individuals, independent artists, and all effected by the storm. Please see the end of the message to see what resources are available.

As recovery begins, and you're deciding what to keep and what to accept as a loss, I want to offer some help and guidance so you can save your vital documents and beloved family heirlooms.

**First thing! We can do some pretty great stuff with modern conservation methods, so please ask if it can be saved before throwing it away! Clean the item as much as you can, carefully, and then make sure it dries out so it doesn't get moldy. Store it until someone can take a look at it, but try to get help for it ASAP.**

My expertise is in books and paper, so if you need help with a textile, family china, a painting, photos or sculpture, please check out the [Find a Conservator](https://www.culturalheritage.org/about-conservation/find-a-conservator) tool offered by the American Institute of Conservation, and reach out to some conservators. If you can't get a grant from the sources below to support the saving of your item, at least reach out to the person who could help, and ask them for some steps you can take yourself to save your item. In many cases, there's procedural guidance on the internet, and I'll do what I can to help you find them.

If you do have questions about books or paper, please leave a message with photos here or in my profile, and I'll give as much advice as I can. Photos are most important, they're worth a thousand words and will tell me more than almost anything else. I'm located in Spotsylvania, VA, right off I-95. If you're passing through and need my particular help, drop me a line and I'll make space for your project and will get it stabilized immediately until decisions can be made.

We're here for you!!

There are two main sections that I was rerouted through the panhandle but it is EXTREMELY rural. Do not miss a chance for gas, not because they are out of gas but because it's so far between stations. There is nothing out there so don't expect to get a hotel. I would not travel at night because there is almost no lighting around the roads and the deer are coming out extra. If you get stuck traveling at night on dark roads SLOW DOWN. You have to be able to stop as much as possible for a large animal that jumps into the road. There is not a single other car on the road in some areas for collective lighting to make a difference.\n\nGoing around Tallahassee you'll get rerouted extremely far North or South. Around Mobile you'll get kicked on and off Alt roads into different alt roads. Expect actual miles to be extremely different from mapped miles. More than triple the time and miles you expect just from traveling rural roads. Around Mobile you'll get put back onto I 10 and the construction is restricting lanes and bringing down to two lanes.\n\nCIRCUIT COUNTY COURT HOUSE has huge LED signs displaying current road closures and updates. Try to get from one to the next because they are in almost every small town. Take a photo of the updated signs every time you find one and screenshot a map showing rural roads so you can reroute yourself if your GPS isn't working. Get with customer service for your cell phone provider immediately and get extra data so you don't get slowed down while on the road.\n\nI know that's not reasonably updated but that's what I got from firsthand travel. Rural roads are always this way to some extent, it's just that usually you aren't stuck on them the whole way wherever.\n\nPlease update your post when you can so maybe you can help others.""}]"

Need Advice on Insurance Claim,"I was rescued from my home near Black Mountain 1 week ago today. All of my neighbors and I were forced to evacuate and I fled to be safe with family back in Michigan. My home has medium damage while the private roads we live on have major damage beyond words. My home is unlivable as the only way in or out is on foot, hiking about a mile through the woods up a mountain. Our power poles floated down the river. We won't have power or water until our roads are fixed, which will take a year at the least.

I applied for FEMA and made an insurance claim immediately as I got to safety. I was approved for FEMA hotel rooms (which I wish I could transfer to those in need, so frustrating), and the $750. FEMA says they cannot move forward with me until I have a settlement from my insurance company.

My insurance company says they'll need an adjuster to come out to see how long it's estimated  to take to fix the damages. I've explained that I'm out of state and cannot afford to travel back on my own dime to meet with an adjuster who's either going to refuse the hike or is going to tell me what we already know - it's all fucked. Unfortunately traveling to be there is my only choice as I'm the only one who knows the way to escourt them up the mountain and has a key to get into my house.

Is there anything I can do to get them to not send an adjuster, and just go off of pictures and video? Or at least cover my travel to get there and back? They're ""working on those answers"" for me but I'm not hopeful. I have a feeling I'm going to have to fight them on a lot more than I thought I would. 

Any info helps.

Asheville evacuee - idea on how to help ,"My family of four evacuated Asheville. We won’t have power for another two weeks and water for another 2-4 months.  We are better off than some and worse than others.

If you want to help, the thing that lifted my spirits the most was A HOT MEAL.  I can’t speak for outside of Asheville, but they have the water situation and food distribution under control.  People have stepped up and several locations are giving away free canned and dry food. 

If you have the resources, prepare 100 or 10,000 HOT meals and go deliver them in Asheville.  Heck, find a parking lot along a busy road, put up a sign and post online and people will come.  
Just my two cents.  Ping me if you want more details, connections or suggestions.

Offering my Aid to Community in need ,"Hello I am posting here to offer any help with medical food water recovery efforts and virtually everything in between. My qualifications are AMGA certified climbing instructor with in-depth knowledge of high angle rope rescue, wilderness first responder, combat first responder, Swiftwater Rescue technician, I've spent 6 years in the infantry in Scout reconnaissance, worked as a climbing guide and Mountaineering instructor as well as a class 5 river guide. I do not mind walking in on foot carrying heavy heavy supplies, I can offer medical treatment IE antibiotics, wound care, and lower echelon evaluations. Can also bring food water water collection and filtration supplies, comfort items, toiletries and even a tobacco and a bottle of liquor if someone needs. Regardless of how far I'll need to hike or drive is fine. Just trying to help out.

So please pass this along to anyone that you think may be in need of assistance from a qualified individual. I do not want to have to jump through hoops and wait for emails to get assistance to people whenever I can just leave tonight making my way to whatever remote mountain town needs help.

Anything helps 💔,"I previously posted about the absolute devastation my family and I are facing during this time ( you can click on my profile to find it ) but we’re , like so many other people , just trying to navigate one thing at a time, one day at a time. Trying to ensure our kids are keeping their strength, innocence, kind hearts and, positive spirits through this . My sister has started a gofund me for our family to get us everything we can for a new place to live , replace and rebuild ( once again in less than 2.5 years) everything we’ve lost , while also keeping up with the never ending bills and normal daily needs for our kids that do not stop. Our biggest challenge is going to be trying to get ahead to save money to be able to accomplish all of these once we’re able to go back to work. I’m just so thankful to have been blessed by gods grace, that we made it out safely. If we would’ve woke up any later then we did , I’m not sure we would have. We are safely staying with family, praise god for a warm and safe place for my children to lay their heads at night…we have a long long road ahead of us, and have our 3 kids , my husband , myself , our dog and cats are temporarily placed in our family members living room ( she was an angel sent from god himself, I swear she was ). To those who have lost loved ones, and also lost everything…my whole heart hurts for you and is with you through this too 💔❤️‍🩹. We don’t have anything to give, but have been helping any and every way we have the capability to. We are all in this together. One day at a time. WNC was full of the nicest people I have ever met…before all of this. Now, after..these communities, full with the most beautiful amount of kindness and love shared that I have ever seen in my life..is what is going to get us all through this ❤️ 

I’ve attached the gofund me link above and my cashapp is: $makaylaray112517. 

We appreciate everything , all of the love and help everyone is sending our way. You all are, truly incredible: 

God bless us all that did not lose our lives in this, God bless everyone who has lost their lives , and lost their loved ones through this horrible tragedy. We are blessed to still be alive and unharmed and have the ability to lend any kind of helping hand in our community. 

Thank you all❤️

God bless the community (fuq fema),"I have not seen hide nor hair of FEMA. I have been all over Henderson county and Buncombe and NOT A SINGLE FEMA TRUCK, person , or sign has been sighted. Trust  me we look every time. What I have seen is the community helping each other on unprecedented levels. Complete strangers just drove up to my house with a truck full of bottled water and gave me two cases and drove off to the next house.  All the churches are giving away goods and none of it is offbrand nasty shit you don’t want to eat. It’s all good.   My neighbors got together and we are doing things for the kids to keep them occupied. If you ever had doubts about how our community is, this should prove to you. We are like no other out here.  The government fucked us over and dropped the ball and I have no idea what they’ve been doing, but I do know the ladies in my neighborhood and the kids and the single people that are having a hard time have been helped around here and we are all making sure everybody has what they need. Hurricane has single-handedly restored my faith in humanity at least around here.   Still no power water or cell phone signal 10 days after it’s been one of the harder things I’ve had to deal with in my life, but seeing how everybody stepped up has warmed my heart. Fuck the government fuck FEMA they let us down so bad. I am honestly shocked at how weak we are as far as our infrastructure and how our government can’t seem to do shit right and actually help where it matters.   FEMA cannot handle this small mountain community. How the fuck are they supposed to handle cities? Everyone in big cities should be scared to death for something like this to happen because you guys are on your own. hope your community is as good as mine or else it’s going to turn bad quickly and when FEMA shows up a week or two later there’s not gonna be anything left!!

Monday morn 10/7 We are got back safely from North Carolina this morning with 2 trucks and want to make people aware what is going on at the moment!We got to our first destination and the help was received that had been needed there- So we headed to second location and mini hoe and equipment stayed there to work on clearing trees and debris and our truck and trailer w/supplies covered lots of small towns for about a 1 hour plus stretch in multiple days checking in to see if help or supplies were needed and were extremely blessed to be able to help in certain areas but there were lots of volunteers everywhere and the big thing is the supplies that are coming from everywhere by the huge loads! Guys please make sure u have somewhere to take supplies before u just head down!I don’t know how we can spread the word to not Take more supplies down at this time!If anything store them here in a container until they are needed! Because I truly believe they will be used at some point with the amount of rebuild that is needed!It’s not that they don’t want help it’s because every small or large town has so many supplies they can’t fit any more in the churches and schools!And there was drop offs every quarter mile some of the towns!We just got back this morning and  we covered so many towns and talked to people driving around all day trying to give away supplies and everyone would say they have plenty!It’s because they have all they need at this time! We talked to locals and every large and small organizations we could and they are all saying the same thing with supply!!We were very fortunate with our own supplies to find a small church back in the mountains that needed specifically needed everything we had left so that was amazing to see!I think they have enough water in some of these towns for the next 5 years stacks and stacks even outside beside buildings randomly. We were part of a operation out of black mountain the last day and the group covered mountains all thru multiple areas with atvs making sure all areas were good-Some of the locals up in the hills are very upset because all these people are coming and riding thru these private roads and they aren’t used to seeing anybody!  Again I am speaking for some of the areas we covered so might not be like this everywhere!!Do they need some help up there?  Yes, some of the houses were just taken right off the mountain side! But all the people we ran into that lived way up in wanted to take care of it themselves and did not want our help!All the houses they said were already reached by mule teams.A few of the places we had to hike to get to them since their access was totally blocked and they still didn’t want our help!They are self sustaining up there and even with no power they said they are fine and have a few months supply and are working there way out themselves!So for atvs and side x sides to ride thru they are just tired of it and are totally self sustaining and don’t need anything!And for that reason they eventually have police stopping people from going up there!All I can say is if u want to help at this time just show up with a shovel/rake/chainsaw/trash bags and gloves and drive down the destructive areas and ask people how u can help clean up!But would much rather recommend to work thru a organization Do not go around trying to rescue people up in the mountains that were unreached!They have professionals covering every inch of those mountains!!The police are doing incredible in every area we covered so please don’t believe everything u read on things about the police arresting or turning people away!If they are it’s probably because they were called out by the locals that are tired of all the people!!U have to realize these are extremely laid back towns that are not used to seeing much traffic and now just have people coming from everywhere!!And please do not take any ATVs dirt bikes or side x sides about every area we covered for about a 1 hour or more stretch was overloaded with them trying to get up in the mountains and people don’t like that!Again if u want to help drive into a driveway that has a tree across there yard and ask if u can help clear it.Basically manual labor is what is needed at this time!And would recommend to connect with an organization that u know u are needed somewhere instead of just showing up and flooding there towns!There is destruction everywhere and will take a very long time to rebuild but if u what to go help have a specific place that u know u are needed!Thanks and please share this to anyone u know that is going down with supplies!!""",https://www.reddit.com/r/HurricaneHelene/comments/1fyd1b9/update_from_volunteer/,1728321341.0,Missfrontdesk,HurricaneHelene,"[{'Comment Author': 'Human_Living_4995', 'Comment Body': 'We need to shift supplies to camping gear — large propane tanks, sleeping bags & blankets.

""Our hearts go out to our neighbors in Western North Carolina. As part of our commitment to the community, we’re opening our doors to offer a space to play and decompress. Now, through the end of October, we’re offering free admission to displaced residents of the following North Carolina counties:
Alexander, Alleghany, Ashe, Avery, Buncombe, Burke, Caldwell, Catawba, Clay, Cleveland, Gaston, Haywood, Henderson, Jackson, Macon, Madison, McDowell, Mitchell, Polk, Rutherford, Transylvania, Watauga, Wilkes, Yancey, and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians.

Each adult with proof of residence may bring up to five children.

No where else to turn .,"Blessings to all. First off I'm not this type of person. Always been independent and capable. I stay in Hendersonville nc. 2 weeks ago had a health scare and ended up passing out and totalled my vehicle.. by the grace of God I had a few scratches on my face and a small contusion on my leg. A week after hurricane Helene hit us and im still without power goin and 9 days now. I'm in a situation I've never been in before and even getting a hot meal had become a task. Anyone willing to help I would be forever appreciative.

"FEMA, I both love you and hate you right now ","So, hello everyone. I will try to not come off as immature or sour in this post, but I am frustrated, so, please forgive me if I can’t pull it off. 
I am currently 2 days into lodging in a room FEMA is paying for. My cat and I escaped WNC/our home with our lives, his carrier, the clothes on my back, and my iPhone, because I am a creature of habit, who, even in my “PJs” (gym shorts and plain T), always have it in my pocket. We got plucked up right before a series of mudslides and chaotic flowing water took my house, Honda, and everything in my life that would be considered a physical object. Meanwhile, while we were escaping with our lives, my parents were losing theirs, in their Chimney Rock home. I finally cried last night over this. I’m so numb, overall, I think…I’m waiting for the weight of these words to crush me; I know it’s coming. 

FEMA has been, so far, amazing, for getting a roof over kitty and I’s head, but, otherwise, heartbreaking. I was lucky to be able to check into this hotel. I don’t have my wallet. I don’t have the ID they demand to do anything like check into this hotel. I had to call around quite a bit to find a hotel manager that would let me prove I’m me otherwise (with iCloud stuff.) 

Now, I been blessed by some friends (actually from Reddit…I’m such a loner in real life. I have autism. I don’t check in with any humans on a regular basis that I know IRL) enough to be able to get a change of clothes, kitty food and litter, and feed myself bread and peanut butter so far. I only have Apple Pay and Venmo rn…my bank (capital one) has been entirely worthless expediting me a debit card (still haven’t gotten it!)…

But I am broke again! And FEMA has emailed me to inform me that my claim has been stalled until I submit my ID or social security card or a document from a list of a bunch of other shit that I LOST IN MY HOME!
And!
NO! FEMA inspector…I can’t meet you at my home. It’s not there. I’m not there. I’m not sure how you’d get there but I can tell you I don’t have the stones or strength to walk and climb to get there right now! I’m glad you’ll try to make it by soon. I’m not concerned about the speed of any home claims. I need access to the $750 people are getting. I’ll try to figure out how to get you some ID. But right now, I’m trying to figure out how to eat and get my hands on more than one change of clothes!

Sorry to rant. But I feel better. Stay safe everyone. My heart goes out to anyone affected by this tragedy. Prayers and love

As in prove they are the POS they think they are. They ""wallow in it"". As in roll around and cover themselves deliberately with it. They *want* to feel guilty and ashamed of themselves as much as possible for how or if they respond to this ( or any) situation. It could be a lot of reasons they do this - probably because this is something they do anyways and it automatic. The size of the problem doesn\'t really cut through that, nothing cuts through that. It\'s not you. It\'s just hopelessness. There are too many things everyday in some place somewhere that they feel guilty about not helping. They can\'t help everyone and no one situation has any less reason to deserve help than another. They can\'t actually know who deserves help and who doesn\'t, they are just comforting themselves with the idea that not all of the requests are real. It\'s a manipulation of ""the real numbers"" in their head. They are burned out long long ago.\n\n You\'ll probably hear it later, ""I could have done this or that"" ""I\'m a selfish person."" ""I\'m a bad person"" ""I said things to you only a bad person would say"" they will try to *prove* to you that they are a bad person. Maybe they are testing you - to make you *prove* that you love them ""unconditionally"". Maybe they just don\'t have the mental energy for you ( or anyone) and are deliberately trying to push you away. Maybe they pity you and are actually disgusted. Maybe they are just trying to make all the ends come out ""fair"" in their head. It\'s going to go on for a long time and it probably already has been. You aren\'t going to snap them out of it today. Conserve your hope and don\'t give it to them to hold. You can figure out later who showed up for what and why. It\'s not that it\'s not important, it\'s just that right now you aren\'t going to get help from people who are doing that. There is nothing, at all, you can say or do to change how they respond.

This would not be a change that is a wake up tomorrow FEMA gone etc another system would need to be strongly supported and established prior to being implemented and funded for a few years so that people who sadly RIGHT now are being affected by it could receive emergency relief. This should be partly funded by the federal government through the current start the process and also by the local/tax payers so it would be substantial amount of funds due to higher risk states etc. This should include job creation to handle understaffing issues. As far as contractors go, a pre-approved list of contractors should be posted and added to quarterly even if the contractors fall outside of state lines etc. (This goes along the road of states figuring/local citizens figuring it out together) Brainstorming ideas of their states particular weaknesses and developing solutions to plan for emergencies, how funds will be allocated which programs policies would need to be implemented etc..\n\n The people will undoubtedly need to be more involved with their local communities and local politics. To be involved to brainstorm ideas whether it will be providing financial assistance to students who elect to go to a trade school etc. etc and this will again be catered to known state weaknesses and preparedness to tackle a disaster. As far as local government being corrupt I agree 💯. Probably why my taxes are already 5x-7x higher than those in FL amongst other states. Once again once people are more reliant on local government instead of federal government for relief they should request full transparency of local officials on where funds are being allocated, programs social or otherwise and will need to be more involved to make sure funds are not going down the drain etc. This used to be how things was done, However for the past couple of decades less people involved and becoming complacent creates opportunities for fraud and abuse and mismanagement of these funds to begin with. Education provided to the tax payers and local committees being established, going to town hall meetings etc. Once people realize what less federal assistance they will have will create wiser decisions on who they elect, why they are voting for certain mayors, governors etc. Overall they will need to be more involved in their communities, know who your neighbors are, officials are etc. We can't expect the federal government to be our parents at every turn. All this creates is a big government, people complacency. Elections these days remind me of Field day as a child Red or Blue team, just now it's a spectacle for adults, and a shame to our country.This democracy/ Republic is not working the way it was intended because of the lack of the people's participation.

Hurricane Helene damage no insurance ,"
We (out of state) got a small cottage with a partner on the gulf side of florida near Clearwater. No flood insurance as it was not possible to get. It got significant damage from the surge. Our partner is panicking saying we need to bulldoze it down before it gets deemed condemned and we start being fined. I think he is just very angry with all the work he did on it only for Mother Nature to give him the big F. I need to know how this works. I don’t want insurance information that I know and does not apply. How does this work. What happens. Who and when would they say it’s condemned. If at all.

What category storm exactly was Helene when it hit WNC?,"I am a South Florida native (since 3 yrs old) now 50. I am still trying to kinda understand the severity of the damage. We are used to categories down here and it’s kinda easy for us to gauge the danger by category. Andrew devastated South Miami, flattening everything via wind. It was nearly a Cat 5.
The damage NC has just looks like what would look like to us as a Cat 4 storm. 
I understand the topography is completely different.
I’m just wondering- was there more to this than the water amount? I looked up the wind speeds per city.

His home in NC is unlivable, and work sent an email yesterday's saying he needs to be back to work tomorrow. He explained his situation and they said he'd have to take vacation days.

To top it all off, the car he drove to Texas needs work done and won't be ready to drive again for another couple of weeks.

Go to [FEMA Disaster Declarations](https://www.fema.gov/disaster/declarations) look for your state and the disaster (tropical storm/hurricane Helene) and make sure the number in parentheses started with DR. Click on your state, then click on where it says designated areas. You will see a map and a break down below. Look for individual assistance and see if your county is listed below. If so, you may apply for assistance, if not, you could still call and ask if you can apply. However, more than likely, if your county is not listed, you cannot. 

If you are US citizen of ANY age (you do not have to be 18 or older to apply) or have a child who is a US citizen with a valid social security number, you can apply for FEMA! 



**2.) Should I Apply?**

I recommend everyone in the affected areas apply. Once you miss the application deadline, you cannot go back to apply for assistance. Especially with this being a flood event, if you find out months later your home or property has mold or damages you did not see, if I am correct you can call back to your application and request additional assistance. 

It does not hurt you to apply. If you think you do not have bad damage, and you don’t want to take funds from other survivors, you are not! Please apply, you may have damage you don’t even know about yet. If you want to help people worse off, volunteer where you can, donate, share information, ask those in need, get active in your community.



**3.) Important Things to Remember Regarding Applying**

•Only one person per household/address can apply. So if you and your spouse or child apply separately, this may cause a delay, because it will look like fraud. Make sure to include whoever lives with you within your application.

•If you are a renter, please if you are calling the disaster assistance number or working with someone from FEMA registering you, please tell them you are a renter. I am unsure what kind of assistance you may receive, but at least try and clarify that. 

•If you are a renter with roommates, ask them whoever is assisting you whether your roommate should be added under your application or submit their own. I’m sorry I’m not sure how you should proceed. 



**4.) Trying to Prevent Fraud**

If you are being assisted in person, FEMA employees have badges. Ask to see their badge. NO, you cannot take pictures of it! Housing inspectors must also show their badges. 

If you receive a call about your application and they are asking for your social security number, do not share it! If you are calling for an application update, they will ask you to prove information based on the application to verify its you. But you should never be asked to share your whole SSN. When calling in you may be asked for your last four digits, but I can’t remember if they do that or not. 

Unfortunately during disasters, there is a lot of people willing to commit fraud and scam survivors. Please be vigilant. I would recommend for applying, you call the disaster assistance or go to a [FEMA Disaster Recovery Centers](https://egateway.fema.gov/ESF6/DRCLocator) However, as of right now, disaster recovery centers may not be open for some states just yet.



**5.) Engaging with FEMA**

I know people are frustrated and this is an extremely hard time. FEMA employees you meet work with a certain function and are limited sometimes in the tasks they can do at their level. 

If FEMA people approach your property, they may be trying to register you for assistance. If you do not want them there, please kindly ask them to leave or ask for the location of the nearest disaster recovery center or the number to call about your application. 

A large portion of FEMA employees are disaster survivors too. Whether it is someone who lives in the area, also affected, from another place currently affected, or affected from past disasters. They know the pain of losing their homes, having to rebuild, and watch their community struggle. You do not have to like them, but please kindly turn them away if you do not want help or to engage. Any anger you may have, especially if at FEMA directed at FEMA staff will not change issues. Voice your concerns and frustrations, but please remember they are people too. 



**6.) Complaints**

If you feel you have been discriminated against or you have concerns regarding your assistance, please go here: [FEMA Civil Rights](https://www.fema.gov/about/offices/civil-rights/external) Even if you do not feel like it applies to you, please look it over. They have flyers and brochures in multiple languages that explain your rights during a disaster. 



**7.) Cleaning Up/Debris Removal and Housing Inspections**

Take pictures!!! Please take pictures of any damages to your property and home before cleaning up. 

If your mattress is soaked and instead of being in the bedroom it’s in the living room, take a picture. Your car window is cracked? Picture. Throwing out food from your fridge? Take a picture. 

Document, document, document. Record anything damaged. During a housing inspection you want to show pictures to the inspector. Tell them what you loss, what is damaged, what you had to throw out, talk their ears off. 

If your housing inspector does not show you their badge, do not let them into your home! This could be fraud. If your housing inspector does not enter your home or stays for very little time, or you have any other issues or concerns regarding the inspection done at your home, call up and complain. Ask for another inspector or a reinspection, you may have to explain why you need one. 



**8.) Supplies Purchased for Helene**

If you bought a generator, a chainsaw, or other items in preparation or after Helene hit, keep your receipts. 

I am not promising anything! But sometimes there is reimbursement for such items purchased for the storm. It varies based on disaster and state. 



**9.) Denial from FEMA for Assistance**

I hate this one the most. If you get a denial letter, please read it over. You may be denied because you have homeowners insurance, but what the letter may be asking is for proof of insurance. 

FEMA does not want to duplicate funds. As in, if your insurance company gives you $100 for missing shingles, and FEMA gives you $100 for the same missing shingles, you have a duplication of funds, and you may need to pay back FEMA. No, FEMA is not trying to “gotcha!” anyone. They are simply trying to prevent a situation where that happens. 

This does not mean lying on your disaster assistance application! Doing that is FRAUD. Clearly communicate and keep FEMA in the loop regarding your insurance if you have any. If you can reach out to your insurance as soon as possible and see what you can get covered for regarding the storm. This does not mean delay applying for FEMA, again, you can apply and ask for updates to your application, especially as your insurance company begins to cover or deny your claims. 

If you got denied for other reasons, you can appeal! If you go to the Disaster Recovery Center, tell them you would like to appeal, and ask what steps you will need to take to do so.


**10.) Shelters**

Even if you do not need a shelter, please look at [Red Cross Services](https://www.redcross.org/get-help/disaster-relief-and-recovery-services/find-an-open-shelter.html) The Red Cross is providing supplies and resources. Please come take them! 

If you repeating “but I don’t want to take resources from others” do not worry about that. I’m serious. Take care of yourself, help neighbors, but these things are being given out for you and the community. Take it, please. Any meals they make that aren’t taken will go to waste, so please, again, take it. They also have counseling.



**11.) Counseling and Mental Health**

If you are suffering from mental health issues, or stressed about the events regarding the storm, please they have counselors. They want to help you, they are trained for it, and I’m sure many of them are survivors as well. Please reach out. This is not our average storm, where some trees came down, we broke out the chainsaw and cleared the road. This is a federally declared disaster, and people working in disaster relief know this is huge on a massive scale. If you feel overwhelmed, upset, irritable, sad, frustrated, anything, especially if it seems uncharacteristic for you or a loved one, please talk to a counselor. 

I have seen the aftermath to wildfires, floods, tornadoes, and I’m telling you, it breaks you, even people who would never identify as being sensitive. Reaching out doesn’t make you any less independent, resilient, strong, brave, etc. You cannot get past this without processing what has happened. Please, understand the warning signs of emotional distress, here’s a link to acute stress: [Acute Stress vs PTSD](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/acute-stress-disorder-vs-ptsd) 

As someone who comes from a military family, I promise you, PTSD is not just for soldiers. Disasters are traumatic events. You got to take care of yourself and look out for others. 

Please also look into this: [Reddit Post about Mental Health Resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/asheville/s/iUrFc8gI7u)



**12.) For Tarping Your Home**

Please go to the [Post About Roof Tarping Assistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Appalachia/s/ZMH6h7iX3f) if you need tarping for your roof.

**TDLR**: I have added resources about applying for assistance with FEMA and the Red Cross. If any information is wrong, I apologize in advance. 

Please take care of yourself. If you have needs such as a wellness check or help needing resources in North Carolina, please go to this post and comment under it: [NC Map of Help Needed](https://www.reddit.com/r/WNC/s/0UpVj1S3Aq) If there are other maps like this for other states, please post in the comments.

**Update**
I am not familiar with them, but here: [United Policyholders](https://uphelp.org/recovery/state-by-state-help/)

Met them in Maui, they also may be a resource to help navigate insurance.

You've the ""official"" figure of 200+ bodies (all states included), then you've all this hearsay on Facebook about hundreds of bodies in various smaller communities. I've read about 200+ in Newland, 100+ in Swannanoa, 60+ in Garren Creek, 120 pulled from the mud in a location, morgues overwhelmed, refrigerated trailers full of bodies, etc. Bodies stuck in trees and debris that were left untouched due to the need of focusing all efforts on rescues. Report of death in the air near a river in Spruce Pine. Some people have estimated thousands of deaths.
Reasons for this deviation in body count include where so many bodies are undiscovered, unidentified, etc, and to keep unwanted attention away from the area (far too many volunteers in certain parts, along with many close calls of in air collisions).

We got a claim adjuster assigned. We started working on the claim. After a month the claim was just about finished. Then they assigned a new adjuster and we started from scratch. After another month it looked like they were about to cut us a check and they did it again, new adjuster, start from scratch. I had changed jobs and the time I was spending on my claim was hurting my job performance. I hired a private adjuster to work in my behalf. I didn't have to do anything. He quickly got my claim done. I had to pay him $20K from my claim, but it was worth it for my sanity. The house burning down was bad emotionally, but the dealing with the insurance company was much worse.

Do not pass judgment! Pray you never have to choose. ,"Please Please listen… 

In 2016 our small home town experienced devastating loss. 

We did not know this could happen. 

The Cajun navy was created. 
Most do not know! The Cajun Navy started by one neighbor communicating with another, jumping in your our boats.. saving one another. 
It was horrible and powerful at the same time. 

A flood can come out of nowhere!!!  All of a sudden, water rushes in! 

It’s literally like a water line exploding but!! You can’t stop it. 

You can’t plan for this!! Especially if you live in a flood free Zone. 

You do not believe this is even possible!!


In 2005 Hurricane Katrina ravaged our state.. THOUSANDS died!!! Thousands of live stock and family pets perished. 

No power! ICU’s were hand cranking ventilators, exhaustion forced decisions to be made.. which patient had a better chance and higher quality of life.. 

Decisions were made we shouldn’t have to make.. But! It happened.

Our family opened a makeshift animal shelter to house the animals, The owners were missing, many shipped one state over, but! All we could do was care for the animals and pray the owners came back for them. 

Until you live through a flash flood. 

Do not judge or assume!! 

In the darkest moments you will grab your child, your parents, your insulin.. 

Even the rescue flights will not allow your pet IF the pet may bite in flight!! 

The wedding venue being destroyed on this forum and TikTok., 

Accused of horrible things..   is absolutely beyond understanding! 

Until you have to swim with your child on your back, save your bed ridden mother, leave everything you own behind.. DO NOT JUDGE!!!

Finally cried for the first time since losing it all. ,"2.5 years ago , my kids, husband and myself had something really unfortunate happen, and we all lost everything. My husband and I have spent the past 2.5 years working so hard to re-build it all, and we did it. Our kids had everything again. We did it. 

Then, this. My kids have experienced more loss and suffering in less than 3 years than most adults face in a lifetime, yet all 3 of them have not let it break their spirits. The resilience and total lack of awareness with the level of devastation their dad and I are feeling , is what’s keeping us going. The innocence and pure tenderness , and just acceptance is absolutely inspiring..the ability to adapt and smile and giggle is just….incredible. Idk how we’re doing it, but we are. The gut wrenching devastation I felt, every time we walked into our house after the water receded and we could try to save what we were able to…looking at all of the loss. Years of multiple jobs, and hard work, dedication to rebuild it all for them and us…just gone. Then I look at them, and they’re still happy, loving and caring ..and I say to myself “ keep going. You have to. For them. They are why. God is going to keep you going”. 

Our community love and kindness though this is incredible. However…the companies most our bills are through ( duke, comporium) and every other billing place I have called to try to figure out what we can do because well, the bills don’t stop. we ( and THOUSANDS of other customers ) just lost our home and everything we own in it, under 5-6 feet of water… we are unable to work until our jobs are safe and capable to open back up and…until we figure everything out with our losses? And the lack of compassion, or willing to work with us..a grace period, defers…time?!? SOMETHING?!? Is just beyond comprehension and disheartening. 

Duke- ‘yeahhh, you gotta pay your bill, but next months cycle will be much less due to power outages?!?’ Are we serious? 

Comporium- ‘ ah okay, I understand. So sorry for your losses. We can stop service, there won’t be any kind of credits or back dates. Still full amount of payment expected..oh and btw, you’ll be charged for a damaged router ($3-400 dollars ) but renters insurance will reimburse you!’ ….are we not understanding that renters insurance here doesn’t include flood insurance…you have to add that too.. 

All other bills - ‘ahhh yeah yall got hit hard, sorry. Our policy says “ we can’t reimburse you” , “our policy this, our policy that” 

After hearing these response for 3 days, I just fell apart today and once I cried .. it didn’t stop. For hours. 


We are all in shock and survival mode and It’s so much to maintain 😭😭😭😭




Edit : there’s a gofund me account that one of my family members has made in attempt to help us get the funds we desperately need. So , if anyone is wanting to help or donate in any way, just message me and I can send the link.

Been through a few hurricanes with the family, lost a house to Michael in 2018.        \n\n1. https://www.fema.gov/  Apply for additional assistance with FEMA. On the main page, there are separate links for Fl, GA, TN, SC, and NC. Each state has a specific form. There is more aid available than just the immediate assistance.   It can be overwhelming, but fill out the form and make sure you pay attention for an acceptance or denial email; if you’re denied, make the necessary changes and resubmit if you’re eligible. And if possible, get a phone contact to talk to a real person with FEMA after you submit your first request for assistance.      \n\n2. Public adjusters/attorneys (adjusters should have an attorney in their firm) can be an enormous help when insurance companies are slow or attempt to deny legitimate coverage. If your life got upended and it’s all gone, the claim should be paid to the full extent of the policy. If it’s not a total loss, usually an attorney can get you the true value for repair and replacement, and their fee is paid by insurance in addition to the policy payout.   Call a few and ask questions. They don’t make money unless they can help, and they exist to hold insurance companies accountable.    \n\n3. Utility bills, loans, etc. are tough. All situations are different, but if you do get an attorney/adjuster, they may be able to help with backdating, grace periods, and rate reduction.   Additional FEMA assistance may also offer some level of financial help in those instances depending on your eligibility. Get that application in quickly and secure any assistance you can.    \n\nTypically, the less insurance you had, the more FEMA assistance you’re eligible for. Apply regardless. \n\nBest wishes, and just remember—it’s all stuff. \n\nAlso, if the house is structurally sound, gut that Sheetrock and get everything wet out after you take pictures of everything.

We brought food, water, fuel and other supplies as well as helped people affected by the floods, but there are reasons why they are not allowing outside help.\nI cannot confirm the reasons why in NC, but i can tell you the reasons in other storms i have worked - i\'ll explain below.\nLet me share with you the first disaster area that i finally realized that this was all about money.\nIn the FL Keys with Hurricane Irma, after Texas got hit with Harvey, we finished our efforts in Texas and were the first citizen team to make it to Key Largo.\nThe federal agencies had US1 shut down just South of Key Largo and wouldn\'t let anyone in or out, even though the road was okay to pass.\nWe explained to them that we had boats, Jet skis, food, water, chainsaws and fuel to bring these people.\nThey didn\'t care and wouldn\'t let us in.\nIt was night by that point and you rarely saw the lights of vehicles in the distance on the individual keys, meaning the emergency response teams from FEMA weren\'t even working, it was all quiet.\nWe decided that we would go in anyways.\nWe filled up the boats and jet skis with all that we could reasonably carry and went by water, around all their BS blockades and around their law enforcement presence on the water.\nIt was 87 miles by water to get to our first stop, Cudjoe Key and Sugarloaf Key.\nWhen we arrived there we were greeted by a homeowner (for privacy, I won\'t name him, though we have video) who was elated to see us and all the supplies we brought, his house was in shambles.\nWe started offloading supplies on the shoreline and helping to get them into what was left of his house.\nDuring that process, he explained to us that FEMA had set up a command center at a local high school on the island, but that they weren\'t doing anything to help the residents, not even bringing them WATER!\nInstead, he explained that they were driving around using a loudspeaker, telling people to stay in their homes. They weren\'t even helping the home owners with supplies.\nI was skeptical at first while he was telling me all of this, but then he said something that broke my heart....\nHe told us that the people of the keys were all in despair, because they had just seen, weeks before, the overwhelming support for Texas with Hurricane Harvey, by the citizens of this country. He, and his neighbors on all of the keys, felt like Americans had forgotten about them completely, because at this point, FIVE DAYS after landfall, all they had seen was FEMA, and they were of NO HELP.\nThe residents were cut off from the outside world, no cellular, no internet, no way to contact anyone or hear of any efforts to try to help them.\nThe ONLY communication they had was from a local radio station on Sugarloaf Key, that was broadcasting on AM to the surrounding keys.\nThe man, after hearing that there were citizens trying to bring them help, but being refused entry by federal law enforcement was visibly upset. He, and his neighbors, really thought the country had abandoned them.\nHe insisted that we get into his waterlogged truck and that he would take us to that radio station so that we could go live on air, to tell the citizens trapped in the Keys that we, the American people, were there to help and that the government was trying to stop our efforts.\nAnd that is exactly what we did.\nAfter that, we were determined to help as many people as we could, but we were met with red tape throughout the whole process and time we were in the keys.\nWe finally we able to talk some authorities to let us down to the Faro Blanco Resort in Marathon towards the end of Boot Key. This was the same hotel where state and local authorities were staging their personnel and they were happy to see us.\nI was able to coordinate several trucks full of supplies to be brought down to the EOC in Marathon. I was privy to the EOC meeting, BUT was informed in that meeting, that all of the semi trucks full of food, water and hygiene supplies were to be turned around and not allowed to be offloaded for distribution by the EOC.\nTHE REASON they gave us, was that these donations were not from companies on their ""preferred vendors list"" and that they would not accept them or give them to the residents of the keys impacted by the storm.\nIt was at that point that I realized, this is ALL ABOUT MONEY.\nThese \'preferred vendors"" are getting part of the money being released by the state and federal govt for each disaster. In turn, some of the ""vendors"" make it on the list because a friend gets them on the list, and in return for getting ridiculously outlandish amounts of compensation for the services they render, they give kickbacks.\nSo accepting outside donations, even though they are on location and can help people NOW, they would rather let people suffer so they can get their kickbacks.\nThis meeting solidified my resolve to help these people, regardless of what the greedy officials wanted, we were going to feed the lower keys that were being neglected.\nI diverted ALL SEMI TRUCKS to the Faro Blanco Resort in Marathon and filled the entire first floor with pallets upon pallets of food, water and essential supplies and created a food pantry for residents to come and get anything, and however much they needed.\nFrom local state troopers to the homeless, all were given wheel barrels and free reign to get anything they needed.\nWe also delivered supplies down to Big Pine Key. We helped establish the tent city on Big Pine Key. Big companies like Titos Vodka and Whelen just kept bringing trucks full of everything that was needed. When FEMA FINALLY started handing out boxes of canned goods (limited to one per household), we were filing cars full of food and supplies for people and pets.\nThere is so much more to the story in the Keys and further from there in other storms we worked- the common theme though, is that the federal government always tries to keep citizens from helping and the local authorities, the ones that live and work in the area are always happy to have outside help.\nI call out to Elon Musk and anyone else who can monetarily help people like myself and those that work with me, who have the knowledge and the will to help those devastated by these disasters.\nHelp us side step the red tape and get the people the relief they need.\nWe are willing, and we are many, and we are ready.”\n2d\nReply\nLiz Ehret Re\nLyudmila Sandefur There is always graft and corruption. The Cajun Navy I believe got it\'s start when the Red Cross was turning people away in Louisiana that were trying to help. I remember that like it was yesterday. It was infuriating to hear. So no money to the Red Cross or United Way. They are both corrupt.\nThere are plenty of good places to give. I have a fundraiser going on my profile with a friend that I have known for 15 years. She lives in a pocket that was safe, but surrounded by devastation. She is getting amazon deliveries and taking them to several local churches. I managed to send her a $1400 order yesterday of sleeping bags, solar showers, water purification gravity bags, socks etc etc etc.'}]"

I\'ve been running around with my local fire department for the past 7 days since we realized how lucky we are to be able to help. \n\n We NEED everyone cutting wood to leave it kinda piled in 12 inch pieces whenever possible to help people get through winter! I know it\'s green but it\'ll be all a lot of people have. The West Yancey Fire department has started asking that of everyone going out.  If help keeps coming in they will start sending teams to stack and collect wood so it can be dropped to people as other supplies go out. Generators will be a God send in Winter especially!\n\nIf you can be patient with the West Yancey Fire department they will put you to work. They are NOT turning anyone away! BUT please keep in mind we as a county have pretty much passed the search and rescue part. We still need a lot of help! They are loading side by sides and trucks up with supplies to get them back in for people who need them. They are continuing to clear roads wider to make things easier so power crews(and everyone else when it\'s time) can get to areas quicker. They are running welfare checks. They are doing so many incredible things while hardly stopping to sleep or eat most the time.  \n\nToday the drop off location for the West Yancey Fire department was moved right next door to the old Bald Creek school (our incredible neighbors who made that happen handled the huge, overwhelming task with such impressive grace!!). They need tons of help unloading and sorting donations as they come in so we can get them back out!! It\'ll be months before many get power back, possibly well into Winter, and we need to have long term supplies. We don\'t want to miss out on donations because we can\'t get them unloaded quickly enough.\n\nI know it\'s gross but if people who are going back out of the area could grab a few bags of trash as they go it would be incredible! We still don\'t have a dump or any trash services. No porta potties or water to run public restrooms in most places either so keep that in mind.

FEMA/Hurricane Helene/TikTok creator misinformation,"What happened out there is terrible, I feel horrible for the people that had to go through this. It’s devastating and heartbreaking. It seems like he’s mad that he can’t get the $750 dollars that FEMA is giving out right now. He only lost his power, which spoiled his food. There’s thousands of people that need that money more than him. Also spreading misinformation on how FEMA works. They help with a lot more. That $750 is just for essentials, like food, water, gas, medications and that’s about it. FEMA does help with housing, damage, lodging, etc. along with the red cross and other non-profit organizations. But, those are different grants people need to apply for. Now I am not saying our government is perfect by any means, because it is not. I personally think they should get more than $750 off the jump. People need to understand how natural disasters work and who is eligible for the money. It’s up to the state government as well, not just the federal government. Our current administration is giving 100% funding back. Meaning, if the governor of NC asks for say 20 million dollars, the federal government is going to give that to them. From my understanding, when Trump was in office, there was a hurricane in 2017 and a governor asked him for funding and he only approved a low percentage. Not 100%. Helene was a really devastating storm and a lot of terrible things happened. It takes time to save people and get to some of these areas. It’s impossible to do the work that they need to do at the drop of a hat. Also, if you have insurance on your home, vehicle, boat, etc. They are the ones that are supposed to pay you out. Now unfortunately insurance companies suck, and they are corrupted, but that has nothing to do with the government. Also there’s people that don’t have insurance and in all actuality, it’s on those people that choose not to have insurance. I know people can’t afford insurance, and that’s unfortunate. But that is what FEMA, Red Cross, and other non-profit organizations are for. Basically there’s a lot of misinformation out there. For the people that need serious help, they will help you, but it will take some time. Which I respectfully understand is very frustrating and disappointing. There’s always more that can be done, but it’s just not reality, no matter where you are. For everyone affected by this, just keep trying to get what you need. I am very positive they will help you, but you have to be patient. I know that’s hard right now. To all creators spreading misinformation, it’s a dangerous thing to do. Please think about what you are doing, and do the proper research. Sending love to all those affected. I am so sorry this happened to you.

Each agency has a role in emergency disaster and response/recovery. \n\nIndividuals who want to help is great but they DO NOT need to self deploy even with the self deployed helicopters. Those who want to volunteer need to do so with the multiple organizations already there. FEMA doesn’t have volunteers. They(private helicopters) need to reach out at the EOC (emergency operations center) to let them know their assets are their to help the copters…. So it can all be organized and the air space controlled \n\nThey had to get control of the air space bc it was a few incidents where so many copters where flying near accidents. \n\nIt becomes chaos and madness when it’s not organized. \n\nArmy corp of engineers, DOT/ FWHA handle the roads, bridges etc. again not FEMA. \n\nFEMA coordinate the federal aid and assist the state. Majority of the search and rescue is national guard, state agencies, and local (if they themselves are not impacted as well) \n\nIts so many moving parts and logistics to this thing and majority of ppl have no idea. The media is gross,the misinformation is gross, and the previous president is gross as well spreading all this division and hate. We need everyone to pull together right now no matter your political affiliation. Americans are dying and it takes everyone. \n\nWhen you are affected by natural disaster this is the way it goes: you are the first person to make sure you are as prepared as possible as a citizen, next is local govt. (this is your city and county), next is the state (this is your governor), then the state if overwhelmed requests federal aid to come in and assist this is MULTIPLE agencies not just FEMA. \n\nFEMA is a second responder to assist and coordinate all of it and then reimburse what state and local has endured (PA Program) along with reimbursing individual citizens (IA Program) when they don’t have insurance and or not enough insurance. Again multiple assistance within each program they offer. Other agencies offer assistance as well as local, state, and non profits to make individuals whole if insurance doesn’t cover everything. \n\nThis is how it works  \n\nIn addition to the stretched resources, assets, and volunteers this is widespread across multiple states. Milton is about to hit. We had a very busy spring (tornadoes, and other storms, hurricane in June) these are still in recovery then this happened.

Feel like I'm not doing enough ,"Hey guys, if anyone in this group is a therapist or has experience with living through other natural disasters, I could really use your advice.

I'm in Boone, NC and grew up in Asheville. I'm so grateful that my house and car survived and we have had all utilities back for a few days now, but I'm absolutely devastated by all of the destruction in my home region. I've been volunteering every day since last Saturday and doing a lot of different things but I'm struggling to feel like I'm doing enough. I know that logically I am, and I've been able to help a whole lot of people by doing food & hot meal distribution, wellness checks in rural areas, farm repair, donating, and posting stuff on social for my out-of-town friends to learn & donate. 

But I still struggle to feel like I'm not doing enough. Every morning I wake up and struggle to decide where to volunteer that day because I want to make the largest impact possible. I think it's just a mixture of guilt from being ok and having my house and car be ok when some folks have lost everything, plus wanting to help my dear community as much as I can.

If anyone has been through this same feeling, how were you able to work through it and feel like you were doing enough to help people?

GoFundMe for Family/Friends/Self,"Does anyone know where we can post GoFundMes for more exposure?

"Pastor Family Left with Uninhabitable House in West Jefferson, NC","As we know, sometimes life brings unexpected challenges. Recently, my in-laws, who have spent over 44 years in ministry, faced a devastating landslide at their home in West Jefferson, North Carolina, caused by Hurricane Helene. Their home is now UNINHABITABLE, and the estimated repairs to the mountainside and septic system are between $350,000–$500,000, with NO INSURANCE COVERAGE since it's considered an 'act of God.' Even in 'retirement,' they continue to serve their congregation. I’m sharing their story in the hopes of gathering support. If you'd like to help, please visit their GoFundMe:

I clicked on the bumcombeready.org link to find out if I was in a zone that needed to evacuate and it was just a general site that had terrible navigation and NOTHING was there about areas that should evacuate.\n\nThere WAS a map that you could click on that looked promising but it was being HAMMERED and my internet was already intermittent.  I immediately texted the map link to my mom in Nashville and asked if she could open it and she couldn’t - so the site was getting clobbered.\n\nI then started googling on my phone to see what to do and then power and internet went out in the middle of my search.

If I’d gotten a text that made I clear I needed to evac on Thursday or Friday I would have as I am privileged enough to be able to afford to do so.

One so bad they quit and one required hospitalization.\xa0\n\nYou have be ok with the idea that you can’t help everyone and you’re going to see a lot of need you can’t meet and hear or see a lot of traumatic stuff.\xa0\n\nDepending on your skill level, training, and where you are working, you may see some death, both animals and people.

How to help after evacuating,"I was rescued after 4 long days stranded with my neighbors up in the mountains of Black Mountain NC. I'm staying with family in Michigan, and was feeling major guilt for leaving. If you feel this way, remember that you're empowered by being elsewhere. You can bring awareness to people who otherwise would be oblivious to the level of need WNC has. 

I contacted the local news for all of Northern Michigan and made it on in the same day. They got my story out, and now I have an article and video to share with everyone I know, urging them to help. I'm organizing a food/supply drive and am putting QR codes to donate to all over town. I'm flooded with messages from people now. People want to help, they just need you to show them how.

No matter where you are, YOU HAVE THE POWER TO HELP. ❤️

There are victims of this storm that may never be found due to the destruction. More will turn up as the days go on. Sadly, I’m sure there are people who were not able to leave their homes for help. A week has gone by pretty much at this point, this will make quick identification more difficult. Issues with sanitation, nutrition, illness will be problematic too.

It’s not a good situation. Many, many roads are completely impassable. Bridges are just gone. In my town most places were one entry/exit only and if there was a back way it was across a mountain higher up. So many trees are down along with power lines. People’s homes were washed away. Even the church I grew up in was entirely knocked down. There is debris everywhere. I say all of this to say that there are many dead and that won’t be found potentially ever. Over time as the community builds back I’m certain more will be found. And because of lack of ability to get to certain areas those who didn’t initially die, may die waiting for help. Winter is also rapidly approaching for some of these people. It wasn’t uncommon for snow to start falling in late October. My area is without power and may be for quite some time they say.

Ask: If they are brining donations ask them where they plan to drop off.

Ask about who they’re working with.

Ask about drones to check inaccessible areas  (they use them in Charleston and might know who/how to outsource people who know how to use them)

Ask them anything you want to get confirmation on or to verify info.

"Im so upset, Ive never been unemployed…","In august I left a secure job to chase this new opportunity, I was at my previous job for 5 years however, the environment was quite toxic& that is why I started seeking new opportunities. Today I got laid off due to Hurricane Helene, it caused the loss of a different office and you know, last one in first one out. Ive never been laid off or fired before and it caught me completely off guard. I have been in sheer panic, hyperventilating, in spirals and bawling my eyes out. I was so happy and carefree when I started this new job, I saw myself in this place long term, everything was perfect. I am so upset I can barely breathe. They kept reassuring me that my performance was amazing and it was a hard decision to make. The whole time I was in a haze, the room was spinning and I felt stupid and like a failure. I am having a hard time staying positive, I am having a hard time finding a will to live right now and I feel like giving up…

Yancey county nc update,"Burnsville just posted a huge update looks like they are finally getting cell service

Yancey County Situational Update                         
October 03, 2024 

Emergency services- We continue to appreciate the tremendous response from our local first responders and from our partners at the State and Federal level.  Partner agencies on the ground in Yancey County include the Sheriff’s Offices from Stanly, Catawba, Chatham, Alamance, Wayne, and the Stanfield Police Department, the North Carolina State Highway Patrol, FEMA, and the North Carolina National Guard. 

Yancey County EMS Director had ordered an ambulance strike teams and now has 13 total units to augment the current staffing and respond to increased calls for service as well as increased response and transport times. 

The Blue Ridge Regional Hospital is still up and running, they are operating on generator but fully operational. 

There is a Field Hospital at the Burnsville Fire Department. There are Physicians, NP, Nurses and Paramedics that can treat patients or, if needed, an EMS strike team of additional ambulances and Paramedics that can transport patients to hospitals. If you come to the field hospital, the providers can see you and if needed write prescriptions for needed medications. 

Cell phone towers- Still a work in progress, some of the tower sites are still in working order but access to maintain them and get them back up and running is difficult due to post storm conditions. Crews are actively clearing and improving roadways to these sites to allow access for essential crews. 

Pod sites- Today (10/03/2024) we have transitioned to one centralized POD located at Altec, 150 Altec Rd, Burnsville, NC distributing water, MRE’s, and ice. 

Shelter sites- Blue Ridge Elementary School has reached capacity and we’ve opened a second shelter location at Cane River Middle school. If needed, we can also open a third site as the needs arise. These sites are being managed and staffed by the American Red Cross. 

Electric service- Is beginning to come on in areas that are able to safely receive electricity. We remain thankful for our linemen and the tree crews for their tremendous effort while working under some of the most difficult conditions imaginable. 

Water Treatment- The Burnsville Public Works is working diligently to get the water plant back up and running. Engineers, contractors, and crews are getting pumps in place to bring water back into the plant, once it is determined the plant can sustain operations, they will begin turning feeder lines on to distribute water. Crews have begun making known repairs while getting the system back online. As feeders are turned back on crews will be able to determine if and where any leaks are to begin further repairs. Once reestablished, the water will be under a boil water alert until the system can be flushed and sanitized. The water will be usable for showering and flushing toilets though.  

Waste water treatment- The plant is completely offline until major repairs can be completed. Engineers have been brought in the evaluate these issues and expedite repairs. 

Volunteer donations- All donations are being directed to Mountain Heritage High School at 333 Mountain Heritage HS Road Burnsville, NC 28714. 

Comfort stations- Mobile laundry facilities are available in the GO Grocery parking lot. Updates regarding the setup of shower and bathroom facilities will be provided as those details become available 

Volunteers- Anyone wishing to volunteer please meet at the Town Center located at 6 South Main Street at 9:15am each morning.

Helicopters turned away,"I know everyone is upset about hearing people coming to help being turned away but have you thought through the reasons. People are just flying in without doing proper check-ins and without contacting the military and fema. Air space is difficult to navigate normally and with so many airports and towers out now new comers run the risk of interrupting established flight paths and making air collisions possible. Not to mention not knowing the area makes you more likely to run out of fuel in a place where you cannot emergency land.

make money from your phone during this hard time.,"I know this sounds like a heartless solicitation but I swear it's not. I live in Burke County NC and we got really jacked up last week and weekend. Given that we were hit so hard, almost everyone I know was/is missing work due to inability to travel among other things and that's caused an immense need for ways to make money without needing to leave home or your family and since I've been using survey and gaming money making apps and websites for quite some time now I have gotten pretty good at navigating them. They are very tricky to figure out. But it's possible. 
That being said, if you need a way to make a little money right now shoot me a message and I'll send you some of my referral links so you can get some sign up bonuses to boost your start. I'll also coach you through how to navigate the apps and things and which deals and games I've found to be easiest and quickest ways to make okay money if you need it.

""WHOA! YOUR TOWN IS TO BE BULLDOZED AND YOU MUST ALL LEAVE. WE ARE NOT GOING TO RECOVER AND BURY THE DEAD.

I can’t post this online because it’s not quite public yet, but government officials had a town meeting with all of the residents of chimney rock and basically told them the town was being bulldozed, bodies and all and the land was being seized by the federal government they would not be able to move back and basically their homes the ones that were standing were no longer theirs and the federal government owned it all. I don’t know what crazy play for land this is, but there’s a lot of conspiracy about lithium mines and let me just tell you, as someone who lives in Charlotte and has friends who live in the area of Western North Carolina, they are not being helped and this is actually being a stand down operation by federal government""


ONCE AGAIN THIS IS AN UNVERIFIED RUMOR AND MOST PROBABLY FEARMONGERING... DO NOT BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU SEE ON SOCIAL MEDIA. I can tell you for a fact people were making false calls in surrounding areas that the dams had burst during all of this and giving emts the run around as well as falsely reporting water shut offs for the surrounding areas. These calls were vetted and investigated and found to be untrue. People will cause trouble and fear and chaos everywhere even in the midst of tragedy.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

CLARIFICATION OF FALSE REPORTS REGARDING CHIMNEY ROCK RECOVERY EFFORTS

Rutherford County, NC – We are aware of several false reports circulating on social media on the situation in Chimney Rock. We want to address these rumors directly to ensure the public has accurate information.

NO GOVERNMENT SEIZURE OF CHIMNEY ROCK: There was no ""special meeting"" held in Chimney Rock on October 2nd involving discussions of the federal, state, or local governments seizing the town. These claims are entirely false. Town of Lake Lure and Chimney Rock officials met with NC Speaker of the House Tim Moore, NC Senator Tim Moffitt, NC Representative Jake Johnson, Sheriff Ellenburg, County Commissioner Chairman Bryan King, Emergency Management Director Frankie Hamrick, Brett Keeter with Congressman McHenry’s office, and other officials to offer our federal and state legislators an opportunity to hear directly from the Lake Lure and Chimney Rock Village officials as to the impact to their towns caused by Hurricane Helene and to request their support and advocacy for federal and state support. Our focus is solely on recovery, safety, and providing support to those affected by the storm. There have been no discussions or actions taken by the federal, state, or local government related to property seizure in Chimney Rock or any other part of Rutherford County.

CONFIRMED FATALITIES: Tragically, we have two confirmed fatalities because of the storm. Claims of ""bodies everywhere"" are completely unfounded. Our emergency services and professional contractors are working tirelessly to clear debris and ensure the safety of residents, and we will continue to provide support to those affected.

VOLUNTEER ASSISTANCE: While we deeply appreciate the community's willingness to help, volunteer aid in the Chimney Rock area is not needed at this immediate time. Professional contractors are currently working to clear roads and debris, which is a necessary first step to create safe conditions for any future volunteer efforts. We will communicate when additional hands are needed and welcome volunteers once it is safe to do so.

HOW YOU CAN HELP:  Right now, the most effective way to support our community is through monetary donations. 100% of these contributions will be used directly for disaster relief efforts in Rutherford County and are tax deductible. Donations can be made to the United Way of Rutherford County at www.unitedwayofrutherford.org or the RHI Legacy Foundation at www.rhilegacyfoundation.com.

We urge everyone to rely on verified information from official sources as we work through this challenging time. False rumors not only cause unnecessary distress but also hinder our recovery efforts. We will continue to provide updates to keep the community informed. For further information, please contact the Rutherford County Public Information Officer at Kerry.giles@rutherfordcountync.gov.


 
 
 

Also a youtuber talking about it https://youtu.be/MYdC-6nShdc?feature=shared",https://www.reddit.com/r/HurricaneHelene/comments/1fvf1e4/social_media_rumor_chimney_rock_could_be_fear/,1727981209.0,JollyDistribution825,HurricaneHelene,"[{'Comment Author': 'Ok-Cattle-6798', 'Comment Body': 'I call bullshit. \n\nAs someone who works in emergency management and has firsthand experience responding to crises like this, I can tell you that the claims being made here just don’t add up. Here’s why, based on my own experience and knowledge:\n\nIf something as catastrophic as an entire town like Chimney Rock being bulldozed with bodies left unburied was happening, it would be all over the news—nationally and internationally. Even in smaller-scale disasters I’ve been involved with, local media immediately picks up on anything that impacts the community, and bigger outlets follow. The absence of any credible news reports makes me seriously question the validity of these claims.\n\nFrom working in emergency management, I know that the idea of leaving bodies out to rot, let alone bulldozing over them, is absolutely absurd. It goes against every protocol we follow. Recovering and identifying remains is a top priority in disaster response, not just out of respect for the deceased and their families but also for public health reasons. There’s no way the federal government would just abandon those principles, especially in a visible, populated area.\n\nIn every response I’ve been part of, there’s a huge effort to get food, water, and medical supplies to those in need. If people were really starving and trapped in places like Hendersonville or Chandler, NC, the Red Cross, FEMA, and countless other organizations would already be mobilized. The idea that no one is helping or that stores are locking people out is just not how things work. Communities always come together, and agencies like mine are constantly coordinating with federal and local responders to ensure that aid gets through.\n\nThe idea that the 82nd Airborne Division is sitting on the sidelines while being “begged” to help just doesn’t line up with how things work. If there were truly a need for military assistance, we would be seeing deployment of resources. Any delay like that would be front and center in the news, and state or federal officials would be under pressure to act. From what I’ve seen, the Guard is quick to respond when needed.\n\nIn all the situations I’ve responded to, from hurricanes to wildfires, there’s always a coordinated effort to help. Leaving bodies behind, ignoring pleas for help, and cutting off food and water supply just isn’t something I’ve ever encountered. Even in the most chaotic situations, we’ve never seen anything like what’s being described here. There’s always some kind of response, and the idea that the federal government would just abandon people without explanation doesn’t reflect anything I’ve witnessed in this field.\n\n\n[Apaches are literally gunships that can carry only 2 people]'}, {'Comment Author': 'apatheticusername', 'Comment Body': ""I know your heart is in the right place by sharing information that you think might be important but this is as crazy as conspiracy theories about a flat earth and faked moon landings. If you are in North Carolina your Facebook feed is probably like mine and is filled with your friends, your neighbors, your school, your fire department, your police, your church, your local businesses, your town, your county, your state offices, people from around the country all pulling together to help people in the western part of the state. \n\nThis is a scary, horrible situation, and I get that but a person can either look for the helpers and see that there is an army of them (literally and figuratively) working around the clock to get through to some of the most inaccessible places in the country to rescue and help. Or ignore all of that and believe that hundreds of people (the ones who would be driving the bulldozers and coordinating all the things associated with doing something like this) would all silently participate in this type of scheme. Ask yourself, which vision of people's hearts do you think best reflects reality? If it's that most people are decent, helpful and ready to come help someone in need, then you can be a helper too. You can reassure people who are understandably scared and feeling helpless and vulnerable to this type of rumor that their neighbors (and people they have never met) have their back.""}, {'Comment Author': 'JollyDistribution825', 'Comment Body': 'For anyone wondering this is where they are talking about.

"If you don’t have the physical or financial ability to volunteer, please consider one of these other ways","https://www.nc.gov/working/volunteer-opportunities/volunteernc/disaster-services#VolunteeratHome-43087


If you can’t physically be on site to any of the N.C. disaster areas and don’t have the extra funds to donate, this website has remote volunteer opportunities. From insurance help, writing notes of encouragement to people in substance abuse programs, sending in t-shirt fabric, kindness calls, and mailing cards to nursing homes! It’s easy to feel helpless when even though you haven’t been struck by disaster, your own resources are limited.

GEORGIA: I couldn’t find remote opportunities but here is a good reference list on points of distribution, organizations taking monetary donations, and an online form to register for volunteer work. Link below

TENNESSEE: Again, I couldn’t find remote volunteer needs but this has information on volunteering and items needed. Link below

SOUTH CAROLINA: No remote volunteer needs on this but like the others, it provides info on active organizations, donations, and a link to register to volunteer. Link below

Sorry if this a repeat of information, mods may want to pin it? 

This is NOT a comprehensive list, there are tons of smaller national organizations like lasagna for love, that you can sign up with. Also, each county in every state should have information on what organizations are in that specific area and can better guide you on what is needed and what to do. Some of the links above will have those listed and some do not.

Official Information Update On Volunteers Being Turned Away,"After contacting the NC Emergency Management authorities directly, I’d like to clear up the rumors once and for all about volunteers being turned away by officials in WNC. I can’t speak for donations, commerce, or travel - only volunteers. 

I’ve been very frustrated by reports of volunteers being turned away while others are suffering and not receiving what they need to survive; especially not knowing if the information circulating was a hoax, religious affiliations trying to mislead people so they can receive financial donations, etc. 

Today I called the number I received from NC Emergency Management: 919-825-2474, to inquire about this situation and get clarity. 

I please keep in mind I’m simply reporting information. It’s not my job to give a personal opinion on policy or dictate how others should spend their time or resources. 

Officially, for the next 6 days North Carolina is still in the Search and Rescue phase. This is why they are asking non-locals to wait before coming to assist. Per them, the purpose of this is to ensure public health, disease control, sanitation, properly handling and preserving the deceased, and ensuring that bodies remain intact so they can be clearly identified.

After six days, on October 9 anyone who wants to volunteer should go to:

NCVOAD.org/volunteer
( https://www.ncvoad.org/volunteer )

Once the Search and Rescue phase is declared lifted (the operator I spoke with said, “We hope it will be sooner, but it could be days later”), volunteer sign-up opportunities will become available through various organizations on that website. I have no information on what the sign-up process will look like, the types or number of opportunities available, or what the requirements will be if any.

I do know some people in the city of Asheville who have not secured water in 2 days. I also know that the military is being deployed en masse today and tomorrow. Again, the only purpose of this message is to relay information and clear up existing misinformation and confusion.

FEMA Complaints  Skyrocketi,"The number of posts reporting FEMA confiscating civilian donations of water and desperately needed items - food, blankets, diapers etc is really shocking. Many posts on X in the last 48 are specifically saying this is really causing tensions in an already tense situation. They need food now! 

Hungry people don’t care which channel it came by and it should not be an issue. Bureaucratic BS. 

 Many are asking please donate at your church as donations can’t be confiscated from them.   
Apparently FEMA takes jurisdiction over many operations in a designated disaster zone and people are being threatened with arrest which is ludicrous given how many people are still trapped and unaccounted for higher up in the elevated communities.

We would like to help organize supplies for those affected by the terrible hurricane. We created a sleek open-source tool to list what is needed, where, in what amount, and by when.

Western North carolina," I'm in western North carolina we are more than 300 miles from the coast above 2000 ft in elevation. Hurricanes dont devestate the mountains like this, The mountains usually get some rain maybe a small bit of flooding, maybe lose power for a day 2 at most. This is unprecedented. Not to mention we had a front go through that dropped between 8-15 inches of rain before Helene even got to us. Places were already flooding and then helene dropped another 8- 15 inches of rain. Serveral places got over 2 ft of rain. My local lake rose 14 feet that's 10 foot over max capacity. Evacuation orders came at 3 and 530am morning of, to late to be of use. When we say whole towns have been washed away we aren't exaggerating at all. Whole towns are just gone. So many people are without power, internet and cell reception we still don't know anything really. There are so many missing and dead and no one can give an accurate total because we still don't know the extent of the damage. The news says 166 dead but just 1 city still has over 600 missing. As people get cell service and internet the totals will rise rapidly. You can see bodies washing down the river *multiple rivers*, through parking lots and in tops of trees. They aren't reporting it. They've brought in mobile morgue and are filling them up and not trying to identify bodies at this time. Whole towns are completely gone and many others are completely cut-off due to landslides. Bridges, roads, and driveways are either washed away or damaged so badly they cannot be used. In some places the land where the road was is gone and cannot be rebuilt. Some are covered in trees and mud and just everything to the point it's going to take weeks to clear the road enough for a car to pass through. Driveways and roads are gone and people are stranded with no way to get help, no way to get to the supply drop offs. 911 was down for days. Private citizens and fema are trying to bring in helicopters to help but there is no where for them to land in the mountains. The terrain is just too difficult and unstable. Elevation changes too quickly and nowhere to land for emergency landings. I personally know people who have been told they likely won't get running water again for at least a year. The infrastructure is gone, the reservoir that supplies the area is gone, the pipes that carried water throughout the area have been washed down the mountain and are so damaged it can't be used even if it was recovered. The electric companies can't get out to fix the power because of impassable roads. So many lines and poles are down with trees covering the lines and roads. People are being told they won't get power back on until the end of October, beginning of November. Water treatment facilities are completely underwater and shut down so there is no water either and when it does come back it'll be unusable. Stores are either out of everything or about to be. Looting has started. People are out of medical supplies and can't keep their prescriptions cold even if they had them. People on life saving equipment and oxygen are just watching their batteries run out hopelessly. Fema and military are telling people who come to help to not come and to leave. We still need the help especially in our mountain communities. WE STILL NEED HELP. Adding photos to comments so you see what I'm talking about.

Communication problems,"Hi everyone. My father-in-law (from Yancey County,  NC) was sharing his experiences today, and one of the issues he talked about really stuck out to me: a lot of the people in the more rural NC counties hit by Helena have little to no access to information that they desperately need. He told me that the few working radio stations are all focused exclusively on Asheville. He also said that the AM stations that were supposed to provide local information weren't functioning. This includes information about road closures, supply stations, medical help, and so on. In other words, very little information of this sort about the little towns that also got devastated by the storm is reaching the people trapped in those areas. This is, of course, being made much worse by the fact that internet access is currently nonexistent in a lot of these places. I know a lot of people are donating to starlink to help get internet to these people, but I keep wondering if there are other ways to get information to them? I know I'm not really providing any solutions here, and maybe someone else has already brought this up. But I feel like it's an important enough issue to bring up and maybe get people brainstorming ideas for how to help. Thoughts?

"We will not forget those who are lost, those who helped, and those who tried to divide. ","
First responders, utility workers, most all the leaders, pilots, everyone donating time and money, and Reddit Mods are heroes. 

The last few days were not the time to jump to conclusions and lie for imaginary political points. There will be legit response/logistical questions and that is fair.  Using a catastrophe to lie and score imaginary political points before the scope of it is known is irresponsible and unforgettable. 

When the stories come out about the efforts taken, the sheer amount of lives lost, what everyone went through you will see the truth- This is a great region going through horrible things. Good people are doing their best and good people are gone. It is not an opportunity for your agenda, lies, and attempted division. 

Please remain skeptical when appropriate. It is sick that people will use this disaster in an attempt to further their own interests.  Please verify credentials, apply reason, and be patient for real information.
  
I can tell I have heard non stop helicopters while in Asheville Saturday and Sunday. I have heard nonstop helicopters north of Charlotte heading that direction since. I passed an almost incomprehensible amount of support vehicles going in on my way out of town. 

There will be missed opportunities to have better helped and that should be questioned and lessons should be learned. Let’s not let liars and scammers win the day.

We have shipped the stores clean and have probably made barely a dent in the entirety of the needs. And it has only been 5 days. We will need to support our people for the coming weeks (if not months... years).\n\n\nAll to say: Western NC, SW Virginia, and Eastern TN need the help of the nation. Badly. Urgently.

I would encourage you to not spread misinformation.'}, {'Comment Author': 'isthereanyotherway', 'Comment Body': ""There is no mixed information. You're being actively lied to. You need to stop getting your news from whoever/wherever you're hearing this from because it's not true and it's not reality. \n\nHarris has no control over any of this or anything else you're being told she does or doesn't have control over. \n\nBiden is our president and he had resources ready to be deployed. There was significant rainfall in Western North Carolina for at least a day before the rain from Helene arrived. The ground was absolutely saturated. this September was also one of the wettest September's on record so the ground was already **ultra** soaked from a very wet month. When Helene arrived, everything got worse, flooding from the previous day was already there so Helene made things several times worse.\n\nThis is also all occurring **up in the mountains**. Tons of bridges, narrow winding roads, so many small secluded mountain towns with few roads in and out of so if you've got two roads leading in and out of said town and both got washed away, there's literally no way to get in or out thus rescue teams also cannot get to them. There were land slides all over, massive flooding, and entire towns wiped off the map. Also being up in the mountains surrounded by huge trees everywhere, plus having just experienced major damage from the storm, helicopters didn't have many places to land. Even airdropping food and supplies down is difficult because **they're in the mountains**. Airdrops aren't just a simple drop and go, you need wide open spaces because you are literally dropping at the very least hundreds usually thousands of pounds of food/supplies/water/etc. out of a plane extremely high in the sky, lol. There's no dropping things in an exact spot and continuing on. There's real danger on the ground when airdrops are done so they need a lot of room to make drops which is not something there's a lot of up in the mountains. Not to mention it being the mountains so there's very little flat area to even make a drop and it not roll from the force of falling out of the sky. \n\nThe videos you've seen with your own eyes may or may not be accurate. Authorities are not turning away legitimate help that is needed. Towns are not being forgotten. There's so much devastation and so widespread and so complicated, not to mention still dangerous in areas. Rescuers are working diligently to get to everyone. You have to essentially triage counties and regions based on how easily you can get to people. Search and rescue is not an easy thing. It is tedious and time consuming and there's planning that is involved. \n\nPlease understand this storm took out a ton of infrastructure. It's not like in Florida when things flood from hurricanes and boats can be deployed and rescue folks. Florida is flat, so they can send in massive trucks or boats to go in and find and rescue folks. But in the mountains, it's so much more complicated. Even in flooded areas, if you can't physically get to the flooded areas, you can't rescue folks. On top of all this, even if you have more helicopters than you could ever need, you can't have all the helicopters in the sky at the same time (I'm talking like multiple choppers for every neighborhood trapped--its not feasible because helicopters can't fly right next to one another, ya know?). \n\nHere's a short video (like a minute and thirty seconds long) of the conditions that were present and why there was such destruction from this storm. From The Weather Channel:  https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/video/helene-north-carolina-flooding-mountains-mudslides?adRef=brn\n\n\nWatch the news. Federal and state aid mobilized immediately, they just had to get there and set up, which both take time and logistics. Do not allow yourself to be lied to, take a step back and use your critical thinking skills. Check out normal news outlets. Everything is not some weird conspiracy. Check out LOCAL Western North Carolina news outlets. Hell, check out any local North Carolina news outlets.

Of course there’s the occasional National type of reporting too but that’s national and expected to be a quick summary &/or brief update as national news (“mainstream media”) like abc, nbc, cbs, fox have an entire country they’re covering on top of global news. My recommendation is tune into legit federal, state, and local news stations and government and stay the heck off of Twitter, Facebook, and TikTok. Bc those 3 sites can be toxic with rumor mills that does more harm than good for nearly every dang topic.

Hurricane Helene parents with kids trying to survive the floods BUT in withdrawl without meds?? (Parents in recovery/ addict parents) ,"Please read till the end!! 

   This morning I was watching videos of the destruction the floods were causing in Appalachian towns: the only road to some mountain towns being destroyed and people getting stranded, even a video a mom took of her and her children trapped in a vehicle and the vehicle filling with water as they screamed. 😰😭 It rattled me hard. 
 I also watched many videos of rescue efforts from people taking it upon themselves to help by: personal helicopter rescues (that the fire department threatened to have the guy arrested), off-roading vehicle convoys with food and water, people collecting supplies to donate, etc. 

   I am a parent of a 5 year old in Colorado. I am over 100 days clean and on Sublocade, which keeps me from a wicked withdrawl. 3 days before getting clean I moved back in with my parents (with my son) so I could get back on my feet. I didn't bring any drugs. By the third day I started going into withdrawl from fentanyl and methadone SO BAD that I collapsed and was in shock for 2 days in the emergency room before waking up in a detox. It was absolutely brutal and I only remember bits and flashbacks of the agony and writhing around in bed or the floor. I could not take suboxone until the 4th day (so it doesnt trigger and even worse pre-sipitated withdrawl by taking it too early). Even after I was finally able to take the meds I wasn't able to eat or move without the help of a wheelchair till the 7th or 8th day (10 days in). I was still so sick by time I left the detox that they sent me back to the emergency room for another day. 
  It was still another week before I felt strong enough to start taking  are of myself.
 I am doing very well for myself now that I'm in recovery and with the help of my parents supporting me thru this whole thing, my child is thriving. HOWEVER, if a disaster hit and I was suddenly denied access to my meds I would fall back into a state of illness and flu-like symptoms, convulsions and severe weakness. Not as bad as my first withdrawl was, but still pretty debilitating I've heard. 
 I also have heard about lawsuits here in Colorado from fentanyl addicted people dying in the jails because it wasnt taken seriously enough and treated like they do with heroin withdrawls/ denied medication. I am convinced fentanyl withdrawl can be fatal in the right combinations. 
 
I CANT IMAGINE PARENTS WITH CHILDREN GOING THRU A DISASTER RIGHT NOW AND NOT BEING ABLE TO ATTEMPT TO SURVIVE OR HELP THEIR KIDS SURVIVE. Its heartbreaking and regardless of ANYBODYS OPINION ABOUT IT - ITS STILL HAPPENING. 
 There ARE these types of parents with kids out there in the thick of Hurrican Helene. (Dont waste space by commenting something judgy, this is for the kids.) 
  It doesn't matter what got somebody in a situation where they're addicted to something, but the reality is that there are ALL kinds of people who rely on something medically to be able to function. These people also might be the primary support for kids, animals, and even other adults. 
  I am so motivated to start some kind of fundraiser or group to help get mobile clinics out there ASAP to help the families (in recovery or not yet) who are trying to survive and denied access to their meds. Or even a group of volunteers that would help with the kids until the caregiver is functional enough to support them in a survival situation. Even injured or sick caregivers. 


If anything like this exists specifically please let me know. I will edit this later and attach whatever I find or create to start getting these people more help.

Experience with rebuilding after hurricane,"I just wanted to share our experience with rebuilding after we got 5 feet of water from Irma. This is for anyone who is considering the future when their house and the all the neighborhood's been flooded and will need mass rebuilding, maybe you're deciding whether to stay and rebuild or move. This has been ours. What happened to our neighborhood was, homes were flooded, one bridge was destroyed but the roads were fine and most businesses were fine. We had fast food and gas stations operational within days. Had to take a detour around the bridge for about 10 months. But trucks and equipment could get there just fine on our roads. One of the biggest hurdles we faced was getting contractors out. There were NONE available - and we were in a populated area of Florida, with loads of big towns nearby. Everyone was booked out for many months in advance, and the quotes we did get were astronomical. Absolutely astronomical because they all know everyone had insurance money so they charge through the nose. They ask ""what is your insurance payout?"" and then they make their quote what the payout is. Anyway, it took us one year to get our house to where it had water and electricity (all electrical wires had to be replaced because they got wet, all walls had to be replaced due to mold, water took forever to be turned on). And our builder actually was our next door neighbor so he did all the work, how lucky is that? Our kitchen cabinets had to be torn out and we had to get a whole new kitchen (and brother in law is a kitchen cabinet builder, so again lucky and fast). Anyway, we were lucky enough to be able to get a year of not paying our mortgage through our bank, and we had to rent an apartment 30 mins away. So it took 1 year before we could move back in, if we had to use actual contractors it would have taken much longer. It took us 5 years total to finish the rebuilding of the house. Then we sold and got the heck out of there. So I assume that in an area with impassable roads, such massive damage as Asheville, there will be extreme difficulty in rebuilding due to no workers, and nowhere for them to stay even if they're willing to relocate. It will take far longer than you think. Just keep in mind the enormous challenges that are coming because everyone is going to be dependent on these contractors and their outrageous prices, and I am sure a lot of people didn't have flood insurance in the area. It cost us 90k of insurance money to rebuild downstairs (kitchen, bathroom, new walls, some plumbing and all electrical work and we did a lot of it ourselves like flooring, painting, lights). Just some things to consider which aren't obvious until you actually experience it. In our area most of the insurers left, and those who stayed raised their rates so our insurance was $1300 a month, it was bigger than our mortgage payment. At this point it made no sense for us to stay in Florida.

Edit: our house was a very ordinary 3 bed 2 bath home, 1900 sq feet, nothing fancy. Just your normal country cottage.",https://www.reddit.com/r/HurricaneHelene/comments/1fug5ci/experience_with_rebuilding_after_hurricane/,1727875568.0,sspyralss,HurricaneHelene,"[{'Comment Author': 'Tenableg', 'Comment Body': ""That's a helpful post. Good luck and God bless.""}, {'Comment Author': 'snart-fiffer', 'Comment Body': 'Where did you move to? What part of Florida were you in? Was selling the home damaged and pocketing the insurance money an option? Did you make or lose money on the whole deal?'}, {'Comment Author': 'sspyralss', 'Comment Body': 'We moved to Pennsylvania, not just to escape the future climate problems but also because we found an absolute treasure of a dilapidated house to restore super cheap(something we\'ve always dreamed of doing). The cost of living here is much less than Florida, and schools are much better too. \n\nWe were near Jacksonville, north Florida. Selling the home damaged and pocketing insurance is not possible because you\'re not in charge of anything. The bank is in charge of rebuilding and giving out insurance money. You just find the contractors, the bank will then approve them, and the bank pays the contractors directly. You do not see a cent of that money. The only thing you do pocket is the portion of the insurance allocated for contents. We had 10k worth of contents so that\'s all we got. We got new appliances and tv and a couch and thats about it. So yeah we had to replace a ton of stuff - clothes, bedding, mattress, rugs, furniture, electronics, small appliances. And it was expensive yes, we sure as heck did not make money. All our books and papers were lost.\n\nWe were however amazed to see house prices skyrocket in Florida, and we were able to sell our house for double the price we paid for it. So overall it didn\'t affect the house price. But that was due to several factors: the area was growing massively, the house market in general went up, it was considered to be a ""once in a hundred year flood"", and the house looked so nice after we installed the new kitchen and bathroom, it was like getting a very nice renovation which attracted buyers. I don\'t know how many of these factors would apply to Asheville, not sure what the house market is like there.'}]"

Please post immediate emergency updates and survival instructions like CPR,"Anyone who knows emergency survival and first aid please post 

 Here is what I got from white water rafting and kayaking -

The people I trained with call it ""Body To Dart"" 

If you are in a current FEET DOWN WITH THE CURRENT 

HEAD UP. You are trying to prevent you head getting smashed on a rock. If you are pushed against anything hard PUSH WITH YOUR FEET. You are trying to bounce off whatever towards the shore. Legs together like a long solid dart. The pressure of the water will hold you against whatever it is. We call that  ""a strainer"". Take a breath and hold as soon as you hit surface. Look around and start pushing towards the shore. Any shore in the direction of the current. Try to avoid an object not moving with the current. FEET DOWN - HEAD UP-  PUSH 

BODY TO DART

Keep saying it in your head now. You won't remember it if caught in a current unless it's right in your mind. GET IT IN YOUR HEAD NOW

This may not be what anyone else calls it, comment your known way please 

White water rafters and kayakers please comment anything. Correct me if I'm wrong please

EMTs - First responders- anyone with water emergency instructions whatever you got. please comment with CPR instructions and pressure on wound instructions. Anything you got for survival instructions. 

If you are in a safe location look up instructions for those in flash flood areas. Text them, doesn't matter if they have reception. Text them on a single screen as much as possible. When they are in service at all tell them to screenshot so they can see it when not in service. Keep texting updates and emergency instructions, road updates, ways out. Screenshot the whole screen with maps so they can follow it. Or try another way if they can't see your most current instructions. Keep sending text of emergency survival as the last text so they don't have to scroll.

BODY TO DART

PLEASE HELP ME MY LOVED ONE IS SURROUNDED BY FLASH FLOODING TRYING TO GET OUT

This is how to survive a water emergency, not wilderness survival. YET 

I am begging",https://www.reddit.com/r/HurricaneHelene/comments/1fu5g2g/please_post_immediate_emergency_updates_and/,1727834780.0,Beautiful-Grape-7370,HurricaneHelene,"[{'Comment Author': 'Offthetopofmyhead1', 'Comment Body': 'Hi I’m a surfer these are things I recommend that have helped and what I see myself doing when I see pictures of Asheville. If you react smoothly your actions will go smoothly. \n\nThese little things are going to sound easy and dumb but they go out the window when you think you’re going to die. I think we can all agree with that. \n\nThe best way I can break it down is..\nf l o a t \n\nThink dodge dodge dodge instead of dart if you mean dart as in keep you’re body straight. Dodging is realistic and easier for your mind to accept. You want your body to move as natural as possible (Thats a blanket statement) being rational keeps you physically in control. Subconsciously if you “dart” and you can’t/didnt  you’re mind thinks fail and then dwells for a  millisecond long in a span of 2 minutes that feels like forever and even worse in your circumstances. \n\nEvery moment counts as you know. \nIf you float you’re staying on the surface of the water. You get air, you put energy in reserve and your body is less likely to get punctured. Everything you see and don’t see is going in the same direction as you are. If you want to grab on to something or reach for something try your best but don’t over do it. There will be another opportunity and thats why having that last bit of energy you saved by not paddling is really insanely important. \n\nAgain everything is moving in the same direction so that means everything behind you is too. Grabbing on to a log might be a better idea than grabbing on to a lamp post that still in the ground bc if there’s a car or a house 50ft behind you and floating just like you are that lamp post does what? Nothing. It’s devastating that people didn’t have the time to be paranoid, let alone and control. \n\nYou’ll never win vs water. Being in paralyses is almost better than completely freaking out bc you’re saving energy it’s upsetting but your mind even gets to zone out before adrenaline kicks in. I know I sound like an idiot but this is what I do when voluntarily standing and falling on a 9ft wave. White water that weights like 100s of pounds rattling you so hard it’s impossible to even know which way is up BUT again everything is going in the same direction you are and your board is on a leash attached to your ankle so you’re being dragged for 20/30 yards but when you’re getting dragged you know that it will all be over soon and you know not to fight it. \n\nThe energy you exert paddling for five seconds can mean l the difference between life and death PLUS if you float you’re less likely to get punctured or entwined by something completely submerged. \n\nThere’s another hurricane developing coming from the same direct as Helene. Off the coast of South America I think it’ll go over the Caribbean through the golf through the bell of Florida again. Helene picked up speed when it hit land or didn’t slow down at least and that’s not normal.  I think you guys need to do what your instincts are telling you and not purely on .gov if Kirk hits the south but doesn’t hit your city don’t forget it could hit a city your resources are coming from. I think that should be calculated too. \n.gov didn’t warn multiple cities when the Wooolsey Fire burnt along the beach of the pacific coast in 2018 and all we had was a parking lot. If I had the choice, I would’ve gone the opposite way to a small airport because my instincts tell me being surrounded by pavement is a good idea. \n\nAfter that I got a pouch from a co called FunWelt they sell  fire and submergible gear down to the size of an envelope. I keep a car key my ss card in it. (Submergible and water proof are not the same) \n\nA satellite phone from REI.\n\nI have no pets or siblings so I don’t have much. \n\nIdk if people need or can but I’d pull out whatever I have in a safe deposit box. \n\nThe sooner people total out their cars the better bc insurance companies know exactly what’s going on and they’ll take advantage of you emotionally. \n\nThere’s nothing in Mother Nature made at a 90 degree angle. \n\n\nI wish I could help more.

\* try to keep your generators outside if you cannot  have each person take turns checking your carbon monoxide detector at night. Carbon monoxide leaks are one of the most biggest cause of deaths after storms.

IF YOU'RE OUTSIDE:

\* if possible try to stay away deep waters where you see powerlines that have dropped. ( you can be electrocuted )

\*  avoid standing in flood water if possible

\* be wary of gas lines because they could have been broken during/after the storm.

\* if you notice any signs of gas leaks EVACUATE the area. + call ur gas company then call a plumber to fix it ( if u have service but no matter what leave and let the people around you know there is a gas leak )

GAS LEAKS CAN CAUSE EXPLOSIONS/POISON HUMANS AND PETS

( signs of gas leaks : rotten egg smell, a hissing sound near a gas appliance is a sign of a MAJOR gas leak,

physical symptoms - nausea,dizziness, eye irritation , blisters and  headaches

WATER :

THIS IS HOW TO CREATE CLEAN WATER IF YOU HAVE NONE

It doesn't matter if you're in your house or outside or  somewhere with dirty flowing water please do this if you have no clean water near you. ( but please be careful to watch out for any powerlines in the water )

step 1: grab a pot or  any type of item that can withhold something liquid ( examples: bucket,bowl,cup,container,basket)

step 2 : grab some type of shirt or cloth that you can use as a filter.

step 3 : scoop up water with that cloth/piece of clothing and squeeze out the water into your item  ( pot,bowl etc.)

( we are doing this to filter out any big debris or particles that is contaminating the water so all that is left in the bucket is just dirty water not sticks and leafs .)

step 4:  start a fire with a match or  grab a dry stick and log and begin  rubbing the pointed end of your stick through the groove in the log, placing downward pressure on the stick. Start slowly, increasing the speed as the wood heats up. You'll begin to see black dust or flakes forming. Keep rubbing until you see wisps of smoke at the bottom of the groove.

step 5 : put the pot or container etc. on the fire and watch the water boil for 1- 3 minutes, after that let it completely cool down completely before you drink it, pls be safe.",https://www.reddit.com/r/HurricaneHelene/comments/1ftttkd/things_to_know/,1727803772.0,Icy-Interaction-8658,HurricaneHelene,"[{'Comment Author': 'EyCeeDedPpl', 'Comment Body': 'Or you could put a cloth/ shirt over the bucket and dunk the bucket to fill it. \n\nOr fill the bucket and strain it through cloth into another container. \n\nA bow drill is extremely hard to get good at, to actually start a fire.

AITA,"Our apartment complex is one of few in the city that never lost power. Many are still without.
Apparently that means we are now a refugee camp.
All of the units here are 2 bedroom 1 bath. And we all share locked laundry facilities and pay per load. There are 2 washers and two dryers for the entire building, about 60 units. We all share a parking lot, a parking lot that currently has a fallen tree taking up half of it.
Just one of my neighbors has at least 10 people staying with them at the moment. They have her door code and come in and out at all hours of the day and night, when she isn't here. She gave them her laundry key and they're doing laundry for themselves and their children, running the machines constantly so we can't use them.
Same neighbor has so many visitor vehicles in the lot that we had to park a few lots down and can't see our vehicles from our apartment anymore.
That neighbor and multiple others have been leaving full bags of trash, and walmart bags full of dirty diapers and dog poo in the communal hallway. And yes, our dumpster is fully operational and about 30 feet from the nearest exit.
SO I complained to the property manager today. 
AITA with no soul?
Moving soon but not soon enough.

*Edit its the people giving out their keys to extra non-guests and using the washer and dryer like a laundry mat then just chilling in the parking lot and literally trashing the place for me

Detailed Instructions to File With FEMA,"If you have insurance, contact them - even if you know you will be denied or can’t afford the deductible. You will need a denial or settlement letter for many aspects of assistance so the sooner you file the better. FEMA wants to know if you received assistance and how much so they can better assess your unmet needs. 

Homeowners can apply for home repairs, home replacement, housing assistance to stay somewhere until their home is safe to live in, personal property loss, and other things such as medical, dental, funeral, transportation, possible reimbursement for chainsaws and generators - there are many forms of assistance. There are often emergency needs funds, but the amounts and factors for eligibility vary per disaster. 

If you own a rental you cannot apply for the same types of assistance, but you may register it as a business and they will refer you to the SBA for help with a low-interest loan. Individual assistance is only provided for the house in which you live six or more months out of the year. 

Renters can apply for all the same assistance except home repairs and replacement. 

Don’t file before it has been declared and make sure they are taking applications. Several disasters have already been declared this year and if you force an application through you might add it to the wrong disaster and it can delay assistance. Pay close attention to the dates you use when filing your registration. 

There are many types of assistance available and your answers on the registration will refer you to the appropriate programs. Please read and/or listen to the questions ***very carefully*** during the registration process. Be specific about as much as possible to ensure you are considered for everything. It's easy to be overwhelmed by everything that has happened, but stay focused on the questions and your answers. If you are reporting a flood but answer no to a bunch of flood questions the computer won't ask you a second time for confirmation and the phone rep can't question you. This is a personal interview and inventory of you and the situation.

You can apply online or over the phone. As soon as it is safe, Disaster Recovery Centers will open in affected areas and become available to help survivors in person.

Once the disaster is federally declared it may take 24 hours for the system to sync up so don't be alarmed if you are unable to file immediately after it has been announced. This is no doubt a historic undertaking, affecting many people. When able to file, go to [disasterassistance.gov](http://disasterassistance.gov) to sign up. To begin the registration process, click on the red box with the words Let's Get Started. After asking if you're a robot, it will take you to a page asking for the location. That is the start of the registration. Go through it all the way, and be sure to obtain a disaster number and an Application ID number, that will let you know it is complete.

If you encounter issues on the way you may need to call in for assistance. But before you do, go back over your entries and check all your information again to ensure that your name and other pertinent information are correct and complete. Something as simple as a misplaced letter or number could be the issue.

After you've registered you can visit that site again, and click on the blue box marked Check Status to create an online account. It will take you to Login.gov. Bookmark that page and follow the steps to create an account. You can upload documents, check your status, and have FEMA correspondence sent there instead of worrying about postal mail. No matter what you may hear, you cannot get the info sent directly to your email. If you ask for electronic correspondence when you sign up and never create the online account you will not receive your letters.

# As I saw on another post regarding assistance - DO NOT hesitate to sign up and do not compare your devastation to another and insist that yours isn’t relevant!! This is an ongoing catastrophic event and we all need to work together to come out okay on the other side.",https://www.reddit.com/r/HurricaneHelene/comments/1ft53ox/detailed_instructions_to_file_with_fema/,1727726641.0,MopsyTat,HurricaneHelene,[]

Help fundraise for hurricane Helene relief,"Hi y'all. I am raising money for my family and me who live in Asheville, NC. As most of you know, we were just hit really hard by Hurricane Helene and the destruction is horrific. I was fortunate enough to be out of town during the impact, but my family (younger brother, father, handicapped aunt, and pets) are stuck there with no power, water, food, or gas.

They are trying to figure out whether to stick it out there and try to find resources and survive, or find a way to evacuate to Charlotte. Their biggest problem with that is finding gas and then being able to afford a hotel and food for however long they have to stay put, as well as refilling any medications they need for me to get while I’m out of town. We all live paycheck to paycheck and will be out of work for who knows how long.

As for me, I would like to reunite with them when financially able and when they are someplace safer.

"Is anyone dealing with illogical ""food poisoning"" ?","This information is helpful to me because of my teaching and experience. If you can give it up.

I thought I was ""only"" extremely upset. That makes my guts give up the ghost for no other reason when I'm *very* upset. Reasonable.

I thought it was very likely something I had brewing before this all happened. Possible.

I know food poisoning professionally so I have been careful in every way possible. Only eating things that have been sealed and I am the only one to open them.   Individual yogurt, snack sized pretzels.I didn't eat anything I could see was possible as a cross contamination source either. I have Chef brain and I zero in like a food danger missile. I know there are cross contamination points any darn way. I've had food poisoning in the past and I'm good at this. Reasonable.

Emergency response teams put a decontaminate in the water, some version of bleach in very small amounts in relation to large amounts of food and water. Your body never likes it when it gets a bit too much. Nature of the beast. That checks.

I haven't been this stomach sick since I chugged a bottle of Goldschlager and gave myself alcohol poisoning when I was 22. Day three on in I'm saying. Feverish. That's not really reasonable.

I know it's very possible I'm sick from a well known reason to be sick. Poop in the water.  Other things worse exist believe it or not. I'm asking who else is already getting sick from whatever the reason. Like it came into your body, not was just something happening. I'm asking because there is simply no possibility accurate news in my area. Yes I did do something stupid. I went in the water! Because my heart got the better of my head.No I don't know how much damage I did, because I don't know exactly what was in that water. I couldn't think. That's what happened. My brain got overwhelmed.

"Tree clean up, PSA poison ivy!!! ","Probably a needless PSA since people are probably smarter than I was. The singular tree limb small enough for me to move during this storm on Friday had poison ivy on it, and I got it to the point of black dot poison ivy (something I just learned about, when you get too much of the oil in one spot). I know there will be A LOT of clean up, please be mindful of the hairy vines. I knew it looked like something I didn't want to touch. Another huge reminder with poison ivy, I know bonfires are huge in the south. To clean up, it's probably going to be one of the major ways, but burning poison ivy can get into your lungs if the smoke is inhaled.
Praying for everyone affected by Helene 🙏 ",https://www.reddit.com/r/HurricaneHelene/comments/1fsvwyb/tree_clean_up_psa_poison_ivy/,1727703920.0,WonderlustAllure,HurricaneHelene,"[{'Comment Author': 'OldButHappy', 'Comment Body': 'So true - and a reason to be hypervigilent about staying well away 9upwind!!)from any burning brush piles.

I'll spare you the details, but it was painful, awful to look at, and took forever to heal.\n\nAlso drove through some smoke in I40 in North Carolina (going 70 mph! Just a couple of seconds!) and had respiratory and eye issues for a few days. Lesson: Assume that all vegetation fires in poison ivy territory could be dangerous. Some people have died from pulmonary complications. Lots of city people are moving to the country, and are clueless.""}]"

Hello.,"I live in fayetteville, nc. it was pissing rain, and the radio threw 7 EAS alerts. most on 99.1 fm, but i tuned into one in 640 am. some were tornado watches and warnings, some flood watches and warnings. on the night before friday, at 21:12 i received a tornado watch. this shook me but i brushed it off. when i was listening to the radio, i received a watch for cumberland county and a warning for sampson county. the tornado for sampson was a severe thunderstorm capable of making a tornado. radar said its rotating. when i listened to am, i got a warning to watch out for fast moving clouds. am could be 100s of miles away, so i didnt worry. i got an advisory after the storm passed that cape fear was flooding and to move any farm equipment to higher ground. i lived in an apartment, why do i need to move farm equipmet? i dunno. i live on the third floor so flooding wasnt a problem for me. it truly is off putting for anyone about the more than 30 lives lost in this tragic event. normally, in a hurricane, i'd watch the rain and not worry. helene hit nc with a vengeance, flooding ashville. ashville is hundreds of miles from a coast, so that was strange.",https://www.reddit.com/r/HurricaneHelene/comments/1fsn5sz/hello/,1727669721.0,IamMorpeko,HurricaneHelene,[]

Lessons Learned,"I had plenty of food and water stocked up.  Flashlights, batteries, etc.  Gas tank was full.

I should have cooked some of the meat in my freezer before the storm reached here, especially the ground beef.  I could have added a bit of pasta sauce or salsa.  Then while the electric was out, I could have eaten it cold, by itself or in a fajita.  Now it goes in the trash.  This is the demoralizing part for me.  I can manage a few days without electric.  I've done it before.  But for me, throwing out food that I could have used is emotionally disturbing.

I have a few extra tips if you want them. I started experiencing hurricanes in 1974...so I have learned some things along the way. \n\n1) if you keep plastic bottles (like 32 oz Califia, or juice bottles) when you cook some of that freezer food you'll make room in the freezer. Fill up the bottles -- I usually keep 5-8 available -- with water and put them underneath and on top of your meats in the freezer. It won't keep your meat for weeks, but it can help (especially if you don't open the door) keep food for a few days.  Also, if you have a family member that is lucky enough to have electricity -- ask them to fill zip lock bags with water, freeze them, and then exchange a bottle in your freezer for a new block of ziplock ice. That can extend your food a bit longer.\n\n2) If you evacuate and aren't sure if or for how long the elctricity was out. Freeze a plastic cup ( or juice bottle- similar to above) of water ( you want it to be big enough so that it is similar in size to your meats) and place a coin on top after you have fully frozen ice in cup/bottle.  Matching size of most meats is helpful because a small cup of water will thaw faster. If the cup/bottle is similar in size to your avg size of meat/food container is will be a better indicator of whether you food thawed. When you return home if the coin is on the bottom of the bottle/cup and then re-frozen, then your freeze fully thawed and then re-froze.  Hence, throw the food out.\n\n3) You probably already know this one --fill your bathtubs full of water before the storm. You can measure out  water to clean dishes. Also, if you use the toilet --you can use a large cup to wash the waste down the toilet. FYI --- check to see if your local water utility has generators as their waste station.  Here in SE Florida a few areas had a waste backup issue after the 2004 double hurricane hit.  Not good!!  Generators were later installed with every waste pump. \n\nThat's it for now ... I hope these help for the next storm -- and may it be YEARS from now.""}, {'Comment Author': 'candy-currency', 'Comment Body': ""Sounds like you have a decent sized property if you're talking about having a well etc. If the meat isn't already totally spoiled, do you know how to build and start an outdoors fire?

We were lucky we could put our food out into the snow, but we didn’t have propane heaters, cellular service, etc. It was so cold and there wasn’t anywhere to go..

Why not plan for each city to have access to school busses and other vehicles so they can evacuate as many as possible before disaster strikes?  And have shelters ready for evacuees, with medical resources, generators, security, food, water, etc.  \n\nAnother thing that can help is for insurance companies to make some changes to their policies.  Instead of insisting that people rebuild exactly where they were, have clauses so that those who live in disaster prone areas can use the insurance money to build elsewhere.\n\nThe US needs a major overhaul of it's dams.

Bucket potties (5-gal bucket with a toilet seat on top) aren\'t terribly expensive and with some plastic bags and inexpensive cat litter provide a place to go if needed and the bags can be disposed of later.

pictures and videos of coffins caught in the flood waters\neven more roads are being reported as washed out or undrivably damaged\ni\'ve heard of so many towns that are irrevocably changed i couldn\'t list them all if i tried, towns where some neighborhoods are practically unscathed and others are just concrete slabs where houses used to be, towns that lost over half the town, towns that pretty much no longer exist physically\ni saw verifiable reports of new mudslides at least through tuesday\nthe company impact plastics was located in erwin TN, near the unicoi county hospital that flooded. they have confirmed that employees died in the flooding, justifying it by saying that employees were allowed to leave, but in their own words, it wasn\'t until ""work could no longer be done"" when the flooding caused the power to go out. by then the flooding had reached the only road out of the factory grounds, and some employees died inside the factory building because they were unable to leave.\nentire towns and those who live outside of towns have no clean water, even if the water stations are undamaged, and many people have wells, which are contaminated. many wells will have to be redug, i don\'t know how long it would be before any current wells are safe or if any new ones would be safe\nthe death toll, as confirmed as of 1am october 4th, is over 200, with over 1000 still unaccounted for (that includes people who may be fine and haven\'t been able to make contact, as well as people who are missing, people who are dead and haven\'t been found, and unfortunately people who will never be found)\nFEMA, the national guard from a bunch of states, the military, the red cross and others from across the country have boots on the ground and are getting food, clean water, and medicine to people. donations of food, water, clothing, and money are rolling in from across the globe.\nlinemen and arborists from across the country have been brought in, my brother-in-law just left this morning to go work in SC, he expects to be gone for 3 or more weeks, and may end up working in GA as well\nmissing people are starting to be found\npeople have started posting pictures they\'ve found hoping to get them back to the people they belong to\ni\'ve seen several pictures of emergency shelters and check in points where people can write their names down to be marked as okay, or at least alive. this also helps with relief efforts, as they now know how many people are in certain areas\ni\'ve seen more and more people offer to help check on people for those who aren\'t in the same place as their loved ones, and can\'t get in contact\na mule farm has co-ordinated with those in charge to lead mule trains up into the mountains in NC to bring food, water, medicine, and even clothes to communities where the mules can get through but cars would be unsafe\ncivilian pilots are taking supplies up, where approved, & bringing people out of situations where they\'re stranded, i saw a video a few hours ago where a pilot found someone deep in the mountains because the person had heard the helicopter and was flashing a large mirror at the sky\ni haven\'t seen as much from NC authorities about the dams, but the TVA has continued updating. the lake lure dam in Nc will need some repairs almost certainly. wataugwa reservoir is just north of erwin TN seems to have been a little low, or built to hold more than it typically does. the tva says that with the dam being open all the way, the water came within 4 ft of the top of the spillway but didn\'t go over it. the river flows through elizabethton right down into unicoi and erwin. cherokee resrvoir further west saw the water level rose 7.8 ft due to the rain, the main spillway has been opened for the first time since 2018. douglas lake, further south, the TVA is putting a mile wide boom in the lake to help gather flood debris. nolichucky dam, which was on red alert, is at a point they can start appraising the repairs that need to be done. there will need to be repairs to the dam itself, but also the earthworks around the structure because of the overtopping. the original powerstation from the 20s was also damaged so severely they\'re already starting to take it down.\nunfortunately there\'s also a lot of misinformation and uncharitable takes starting, as they always do around this kind of thing. i\'ve already seen scams, AI images, pictures and videos from other tragedies, all posted as if they were real and true. people blaming this or that person in any sort of power for decisions they have, or haven\'t, made. some vary uncharitable assumptions about relief workers and first responders.\nwe\'ve also reached the point that always happens, where people try to help without going through proper channels, and have gotten turned away. you may have seen headlines about a civilian pilot who was threatened with arrest if he didn\'t leave when trying to rescue someone, the situation is a bit complicated, but gist is he didn\'t have an approved flight plan, and he was asked to leave and did not comply with the fire chief and that\'s when he was told he could be arrested. \xa0the first responders can\'t just have anybody and everybody going out on their own into still unstable areas, with no communication. they have a duty to safety, and they can\'t let random volunteers just go off unsupervised because they can\'t guarantee their safety'}, {'Comment Author': 'Beautiful-Grape-7370', 'Comment Body': ""Thank you.
