They obviously have never dealt with a hurricane before'}, {'Comment Author': 'ShimmeryPumpkin', 'Comment Body': ""There are people who truly can't evacuate and my heart breaks for them. There are also a lot of people who just didn't take this storm seriously, at least in the Tampa/St Pete area, and that's what is frustrating a lot of people. Once the flood waters started rising these people were suddenly able to call for water rescues and leave. People living in near million dollar homes on the water surely should have the means to have left in the first place, but for those who really don't, dispelling a few things for next time:\n\n\n1. No transportation - the state was providing free Ubers to hotels and shelters. Some areas were providing free bus transportation. If you called the sheriff's department or fire department they would either help you or get you in contact with another resource that would help you. Also, ask your neighbors. Most of us are more than willing to help each other out in these serious situations.\n\n\n2. No shelter - shelters are free and many are pet friendly, in some counties for this storm all of the shelters were pet friendly. Many hotels are more lax with their pet policies too, just call and ask. It is illegal for hotels to raise prices after a state of emergency has been declared, if you see this happening you need to report it. And if you have the means to travel to a hotel that's further out, consider doing that so that those who can't have access to closer hotels.\n\n\n3. If you have to leave late, don't take the highway. If you have to work the day of the storm and it's outside the evacuation zone, consider bringing everything with you and sheltering by your work. If you have pets see if there's a boarding place nearby you can drop them off when you work - the place I take my dog is outside of the evacuation zones and stays open (and would likely be flexible with costs for someone in need). Worst case contact the animal shelters and see if they offer temporary care/housing - it's not a great solution but it's better than them drowning.\xa0\n\n\nAgain, this is not placing blame on anyone who truly couldn't leave or didn't know about available resources. I think I'll get into the habit of posting these things before a big storm even if many will call it overreacting. Remember that there are a lot of us who will help each other out - I saw many posts in a local dog group of people offering to shelter pets for free. Once the storm surge came in, many people were rescued by fellow Floridians on jet skis coordinating with\xa0Facebook groups because the officials were overwhelmed with calls. If you ask for help, you will probably get it, even if you just moved here and don't know anyone, hop on your local reddit thread or neighborhood group and just ask. This goes for people living far away from elderly parents too - I would have gladly driven grandma to the hotel and shared my room with her.""}, {'Comment Author': 'slickrok', 'Comment Body': ""Thank you for this phrasing.

Florida building code specifically talks about handling 3-second gusts of 200mph winds, and how the walls and roof need to be engineered to survive those loads. \n\nAnd we get lots of opportunity try again if something doesn't work. As we've seen, Mother Nature is only too happy to wipe a foundation clean if the building on it isn't up to the task. Near the coasts, we effectively live in bomb shelters, because everything that isn't built that way gets destroyed. \n\nThat's not the case in other states. Coastal regions often have similar requirements to Florida's building codes, especially North Carolina's Cape Hatteras region, where hurricanes are a semi-regular feature. But the inland areas of those states do no follow suit. They feel the effects of a hurricane making land fall, but much less - land kills the storm quickly. \n\nBut Helene didn't follow that rule this time.

Hurricane Helene Scam Alert!,"**Got this email from my Congressman:**

As despicable as it sounds, scam artists and criminals are already hard at work attempting to take advantage of individuals in the wake of Hurricane Helene.¬†

These loathsome individuals often prey on storm victims who are seeking assistance though identity theft, fraud, price gouging phone calls and even showing up at your door claiming they want to help.¬†

In certain circumstances, thieves apply for FEMA assistance using names, addresses and Social Security numbers they have stolen from people affected by storms.¬†

Please see below for some helpful information on how to help protect you and your family from these scams and stay informed.

**Residents Warned to Beware of Fraud and Scams After Hurricane Helene**

Hillsborough County is warning residents to beware of fraud and scams after Hurricane Helene. Following a disaster, qualified contractors are usually in high demand and booked up for months. Scammers or unqualified out-of-state workers may flood in to take advantage of Floridians in need of expert service.

The Florida Department of Financial Services¬†is warning residents not to succumb to high pressure sales from people who show up at your doorstep wanting to help. This includes not conducting any business by paying cash and not signing any paperwork from unqualified workers. If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Your first call should be to your insurance agent, insurance carrier or The Florida Department of Financial Services at 1-877-MY-FL-CFO (1-877-693-5236).

**If property is damaged from the storm, the Florida Attorney General‚Äôs Office offers these tips when hiring a contractor:**

* **Insurance evaluation**¬†- Ensure repair work will be covered under your insurance policy. Have an insurance company evaluate damage before arranging repairs.
* **Estimates**¬†‚Äì Obtain at least three written, itemized estimates on bids or repairs
* **Bogus offers**¬†- Watch out for unsolicited offers or contractors claiming to perform repairs at a discount with leftover supplies from another job
* **Do your research**¬†‚Äì To check on a company‚Äôs reputation, look for references online or ask a friend. Also check to see if a company is properly licensed, insured, and if there are any consumer complaints filed against a licensed contractor at¬†[MyFloridaLicense.com](http://MyFloridaLicense.com)¬†or by calling the Florida Attorney General‚Äôs Office at (866) 9NO-SCAM.
* **Bonded**¬†- Make sure a contractor is bonded and verified with a bonding agency
* **Read the fine print**¬†‚Äì Although it may be daunting, read the entire contract before signing to ensure it includes the required buyer‚Äôs right to cancel language. Understand penalties that may be imposed for cancellation.
* **Liens**¬†- Insist on releases of any liens that could be placed on the property from all subcontractors prior to making final payments. Homeowners may unknowingly have liens placed against their properties by suppliers or subcontractors who have not been paid by the contractor. If the contractor fails to pay them, the liens will remain on the title.
* **Deposits and final payment**¬†- Never pay the full amount of a repair expense upfront and be wary before providing large deposits. Do not sign a certificate of completion or make final payment until satisfied with the work performed.

Individuals and businesses looking to contribute to storm relief efforts should be cautious of imposter GoFundMe style crowdfunding websites and charity scams. Hillsborough County residents can donate to the¬†Hillsborough County Disaster Relief Fund¬†or¬†Florida Disaster Fund.

**The Federal Trade Commission offers these tips to avoid charity scams:**

* **Don‚Äôt rush**¬†‚Äì Take your time, don‚Äôt let anyone rush you into making a donation
* **Beware of Thank You‚Äôs**¬†- Some scammers try to trick you into paying them by thanking you for a donation that you never made
* **Fake caller ID numbers**¬†- Scammers can change caller ID numbers to make a call look like it‚Äôs from a local area code
* **Use credit cards or checks**¬†- If someone wants donations in cash, by gift card, or by wiring money, don‚Äôt do it. To be safer, pay by credit card or check.
* **Keep good records**¬†- It‚Äôs a good practice to keep a record of all donations and review your statements closely to make sure you‚Äôre only charged the amount you agreed to donate ‚Äì and that you‚Äôre not signed up to make a recurring donation
* **Know the recipient**¬†- Before clicking on a link to donate online, make sure you know who is receiving your donation. Read¬†Donating Through Crowdfunding, Social Media, and Fundraising Platforms for more information.

**The Federal Emergency Management Agency gives the following tips to avoid scams, protect your identity and stay informed:**

* **No fees**¬†- FEMA, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Small Business Administration and other federal agencies will never charge you for disaster assistance.

My husband and I lived through our first tornado,"Around 5 PM the day of the hurricane, 3 or so hours before the storm was supposed to affect us at all, my husband and I lived through our first tornado. Just minutes after being outside finishing putting up makeshift shutters and putting things away that could go flying in the hurricane.
I said ""Babe, we've had a long day preparing and neither of us have eaten any food. We REALLY need to go inside"" I said it with some urgency, and even felt that it was important we go inside and rest.
We sat down inside, I took one bite of my food. Then I felt an urge to pray. I put down my food and prayed out loud with my husband for God's protection in the path of this storm and that He would keep us and those in it's path safe. I thanked God for our home and all of our blessings.
A minute or two later, I got a tornado warning on my phone... And all of the sudden, very quickly, the whole trailer (yes, trailer!) is shaking violently, and through one of the windows with unfinished makeshift ""shutters"", I saw it pass through our yard. I screamed at the top of my lungs to my husband to get under something! ""ITS A F^$&@<$ TORNADO, GET DOWN"" I yelled. Minutes before this my mom had been texting me urgently about tornadoes cropping up all over our county. She kept warning me. She said to get a helmet if I hear a train. When the tornado hit, I dove under my heavy desk with my helmet on and waited in the fetal position until I thought it was gone.
And once it had passed, my husband and I went outside to survey the damage...
Almost every tree around our property has been downed. For the record, we basically live in a little rainforest. We used to not be able to see into amy of our neighbor's yards.
One tree fell into the roof but didn't do any major damage. Our plants are all destroyed, backyard has been just torn and shredded to pieces. This tornado ripped stuff up like it was nothing. Meanwhile, in our shanty little trailer, fortified only with shutters we literally made out of garbage we had, my husband and I are perfectly fine. At this point we are both totally in shock.
We decided very quickly to put all of our most valuable possessions together and leave before the actual hurricane hit. Thankfully my brother-in-law and his wife are so hospitable and welcomed us right in.
If all of my things got destroyed but my husband and I are still alive, I'm happy. The tornado was so unexpected and came before the storm was even here. I believe the timing of us going inside and taking cover had to be God's timing. We are so thankful for God's protection and we have plans to help our community and the surrounding communities in the aftermath of this monster of a storm.  Others near us were not nearly so lucky. People died in cities all around us. It's so so tragic. Brick homes were taken out by tornadoes in neighborhoods near us. Many people died. Please pray for the families affected by this awful tragedy, and also those still recovering from Hurricane Helene and now dealing with more trouble from Milton. Farther North people had to be evacuated. I have no clue how North Florida is but I can not imagine. I have full plans to go out and do as much disaster relief as possible. A week ago before we knew about Milton, I was passing out flyers trying to get people to donate supplies to Helene's victims. It's all so scary.
Thank you for your thoughts and prayers. So many weren't so lucky as us yesterday and it's not all over yet.
Praying for those who lost homes or worse, family... God bless these people.

That was pretty apocalyptic, and I remember it taking over a month for power and water to come back. I was inside my house the whole time because I had just moved here and everybody told me it was going to go towards the bend, then it took a hard right turn right into us instead. There was points where I was pretty sure that roof was coming off, sounded like a dragon or something breathing up there for 14 hours straight, and then all the sounds of things exploding hitting the house and watching everything get torn apart. My roof did hold but most of the shingle and some plank was gone. All the landscaping was destroyed, fence was ripped apart, debris everywhere, sticks in the stuff in the ground like javelins, glass all over the place. \n\nSurvived by getting water and food and showers from local camps at churches and FEMA stuff. A lot of national guard I remember a ton of helicopters going over to the islands all day everyday for a long time. It did $100k of damage to my new house, and it took almost a year to get insurance to cover even half of it. \n\nI remember this now and understanding that this is unfortunately what the folks of Big bend are going through right now.

Update on the Biden-Harris Administration‚Äôs Response to Hurricane Milton.,"On Friday night, President Biden immediately approved Florida Governor Ron DeSantis‚Äôs request for a Major Disaster Declaration for Florida. People in 34 counties in Florida, in addition to the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, can now apply for FEMA assistance ‚Äì including immediate aid to help with urgent needs like food, water and baby formula, as well as longer term needs like home repairs and rental assistance. If you are in a county eligible for both Helene and Milton disaster assistance, you need to submit separate applications for each disaster. You can apply by:

* Visiting [DisasterAssistance.gov](http://DisasterAssistance.gov)
* Calling 1-800-621-3362
* Using the FEMA App

Tomorrow, President Biden will travel to Florida to visit areas impacted by Hurricane Milton, meet with first responders and personnel on the ground, and hear firsthand from the community members as response and recovery continues.

We continue to urge people impacted by Hurricane Milton to stay safe. Pay attention to local officials, do not touch downed powerlines, be safe during an outage, and use generators safely. We will be with you for as long as it takes.

**Update 1 ‚Äì October 15, 2024**

As of today, FEMA has approved over $619 million in assistance for those affected by **Hurricane Milton** ‚Äì which includes $15 million in assistance for individuals and communities and over $604 million for debris removal and activities to save lives, protect public health and safety, and prevent damage to public and private property. 21 shelters are currently housing over 2,000 people impacted by Milton ‚Äì a significant decrease from nearly 13,000 last Friday.

In response to **Hurricane Helene**, FEMA has approved more than $195.4 million in housing and other types of assistance for survivors in Florida. Nine Disaster Recovery Centers are open in Bradenton, Branford, Glen Saint Mary, Lake City, Largo, Live Oak, Madison, Perry, and Sarasota.

We continue to urge survivors to register for federal assistance.

Why do Hurricanes never seem to impact South East Florida?,"I have lived in Florida for over 6+ years now and can‚Äôt recall a significant hurricane to impact Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties. 

On the flip side the gulf side seems to be getting hurricanes disproportionately. Since 2017 SW Florida has had Irma, Helene, Ian, and Idalia. The Panhandle also has had their fair share of hurricanes.  

What‚Äôs with the hurricanes never impacting the Atlantic side?  Tampa had been on the lucky side until Helene. But dang it, keeps hitting the Big Bend and SWFL!

How are you paying for Hurricane damage? ,"Serious question. If Hurricane Helene or Milton damaged your home, how are you paying to fix it, rebuild, or your deductible if you have insurance?

You weren‚Äôt complaining.  This is a great question I can only assume many people have.  \n\n2.  Most tradesman and construction professionals have experience with their clients submitting claims to homeowners/flood insurances, so expect a delay in payment.  When you are ready to repair/replace the roof ask what their procedures are for payment.  Ask if they work with any financial companies that will finance your roof then research their loan terms to determine if it‚Äôs a good option for you.  \n\n3.  Insurance doesn‚Äôt always pay you or agree you need a new roof.  I highly highly suggest your don‚Äôt wait for a claim approval or payment to begin construction.  This is from my own experience as well as the experience of much of my community.  Some people are still to this day waiting on payment for their Ian damage, the storm was over 2 years ago. I didn‚Äôt come to an agreement with my insurance company until May of this year.  Had I waited for then to actually pay me what I‚Äôm due, I‚Äôd be open to the elements for years.  WTF\n\n4.  Call your mortgage company and ask them what, if anything,  they are offering to assist their customers at this time.  I‚Äôve heard banks tacking on the cost to repair to the end of the mortgage so it‚Äôll extend your payments‚Ä¶. Not the best scenario but it‚Äôs EXPONENTIALLY better than watching rain fall through your brand new leak for any more than never.  \n\n5.  Put it on a Credit Card and keep researching/trying to find a better solution . \n\n6:  I used a public adjuster for my very large, very damaged dome after Ian.  Yes, their fee was 10%, but I needed he PAs experience and  knowledge to fight the insurance company and get my claim paid with what I needed to make my home habitable again.  She did greatgg me what I needed to get the house back to its former glory.  \n\n6.  Do anything and everything you can to mitigate the damage starting with the roof and then working on drying out everything to avoid mold.  This will save you money on labor when hiring someone when they have lees work to do.  Have a leak, get a tarp .  Water coming through leak in roof causing discoloration in the ceiling?  Rip out the 1 foot at a time to check how wet it is and how far out from the leak the water traveled .  Take out the insulation too.  The drier you can get your home and the quicker you can protect the inside from the elements, you‚Äôll have less expenses and less tradesman and leas stress about the condition after being damaged.  \n\n*That is YOUR HOUSE and you are entitled to keep it habitable, comfortable and mitigate anything unhealthy or dangerous you believe is necessary.

New to Florida and the US. Should I prepare for Hurricane Milton?,"I am from the UK and came to Florida in the summer. I have the hurricane tracker app, and I also have had flood alerts through apple weather for the next 6 days. I am in Vero Beach, about 150 miles north of Miami.

Should I be concerned about Hurricane Milton? I read that it is normal to prepare bottled water, canned food, flashlight and batteries, first aid kit etc. in case of a hurricane. Should I just watch it for the next 2 or so days or just prepare early? I don't know what I should be doing right now. We were only mildly effected by Helene and the path wasn't close so I didn't do anything in preparation but this time we could be right in the center of it.

Thanks for any advice in advance. Genuinely starting to worry a bit after seeing some of the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.",https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/1fx2pd5/new_to_florida_and_the_us_should_i_prepare_for/,1728169272.0,mikeindeyang,florida,"[{'Comment Author': 'Swampyfaerie', 'Comment Body': 'If you‚Äôre in vero beach you likely aren‚Äôt gonna get much affects at all with the way it is now but it‚Äôs still expected to change!

Last storm to hit us in any significant way was Wilma back in '05 and that was only because folks were still recovering from Fran and Jeanne.

Pretty sure the longest time we were without power was for 6 days after Jeanne (at least where I was located). If you are on a grid with important resources nearby like a store or medical facility then your wait time for getting power back will probably be cut in half as those prioritized.\n\nWe *should* be alright. The rainfall WILL flood some places. If we're unlucky we may get tornado warnings but those are rare and never tend to last long. Downtown Vero gets flooded bad.

The lagoon being close by does help with draining but it takes a while.\n\nI live in a piece of shit house that's had prior roof damage. We didn't board for Matthew because we are broke as hell. The only damage we received was a slightly torn porch screen and a tennis ball that was left in our yard didn't move an inch. The crap ton of leaves everywhere was the worst, big neighborhood effort to clean that up. I consider this all very lucky for us. We still have our oil lamps from Frances and Jeanne and besides those and our pathetic little first aid kit that is literally all the supplies we have. I'm hoping we won't need to use any of it. House owner plans to sell soon so maybe he will board it for us, idk. Would be nice but I'm not planning on it.\n\nPlease still prepare in any way that you can.

I live in the Panhandle and am terrified of tornadoes and hurricanes,"In 2018 I went through Hurricane Michael and it traumatized me. Ever since then, whenever hurricanes or especially tornadoes are possible is my area, I get major anxiety. I can't eat, I don't sleep well and find myself checking the weather for any changes even days before the weather is supposed to be bad. I've lived here my whole life and the weather never used to bother me. I guess I have a question fom more knowledgeable Floridians than me. Are tornadoes here a great concern that this concern is justified? I live in a house and not a mobile home so I know that's a little better I guess. I've read that tornadoes here are weaker compared to the one's in the Midwest. Anyways, just trying to figure out a way to cope and live normally again. Thanks everyone!

Florida honeymoon roadtrip end of October - route after Helene?,"Hey there, I hope you are all doing well after this terrible hurricane! There was also a lot of news coverage here in Switzerland. So sad to see those pictures :(

We are a freshly married couple from Switzerland and will spend our honeymoon in beautiful Florida end of October. We have planned the following route for our 2 weeks roadtrip and already booked all our hotels. I find it difficult to get reliable information about how those cities/beaches have been impacted by Helene. Do you see any need to adjust our route already now? As far as I could read from the news, probably St. Pete Beach and Manasota Key were quite heavily impacted, right?

Hurricane Milton ,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôve been following the updates on Hurricane Milton and I‚Äôm feeling really concerned. I just watched some TikToks where people mentioned they‚Äôre not evacuating due to the high costs and limited resources. Many have pets, the highways are blocked, flights are super expensive, and gas stations are running out of fuel. 

Living in Savannah, GA, I experienced some impact from Hurricane Helene, and it was my first time dealing with something like that. We were without power for a couple of days, and honestly, I wasn‚Äôt prepared at all. 

I‚Äôm really worried about how people are managing in situations like this. For those who have been through similar storms, how do you cope? What strategies do you use to stay safe and prepared?

Can I break my lease?,"Two months we had a hurricane here in Florida and it caused a leak in our ceiling and roof and we told management and they sent out maintenance right over the next day but then did nothing after telling us the roof would be repaired asap, well a month later after no roof fixing occurred and we still had Sheetrock that was wet, well started to see mold appearing down the hall growing very faint above the shower and then small black spots around the first leak, and we reached back out asking when it would be repaired and they basically gaslit us saying they could repair the Sheetrock but they can't fix the roof yet and saying it would be a waste to fix the Sheetrock because the root would need to be repaired so we asked for an eta and and a mold test and they stopped responding.

A week ago we had another leak from hurricane Helene and so we emailed them again expressing our concern for health and mold and asking when they can come and fix it and saying we are worried about mold and want to have it repaired asap or we want to have the ability to break our lease. And they haven't responded yet and it's been a few days. The reason I emailed is for documentation proof that he attempted to reach them.

Under Florida statute 83.56 it says the landlord must repair mold or leaks within 7 days of the tenant bringing notice to it or they can legally break their lease, what do I do now?

How reliable is the flood zone designation,"After seeing all the devastation in Florida from Hurricane Helene, I am wondering how much we can rely upon the FEMA flood zone designation. Although Helene crossed SW Florida 100+ miles west, the damage has been severe.

Hurricanes/ Insurance ,"With Hurricanes Helene and Milton hitting our state back-to-back and recovery efforts underway, it‚Äôs time we seriously discuss the future of insurance and how we prepare for storms. I was personally impacted by Hurricane Michael‚Äîstaying through the storm, which I‚Äôll never do again. My house, built in 2015, held up well, but a tree from my neighbor‚Äôs yard fell on it. Thankfully, Gulf Stream Insurance helped with the repairs, but without that tree damage, my home would‚Äôve been fine. That insurance company is now bankrupt and not in existence anymore. 

I‚Äôm starting to wonder if our state will ever make changes, like stopping insurance for homes built right on the coast or updating building codes to handle stronger storms. We also need to reconsider allowing new mobile or modular homes in disaster-prone areas. Homes built in the 70s, 80s, and 90s weren‚Äôt designed for the kind of storms we see today, and something has to change with how they‚Äôre insured. Additionally, we need better drainage systems, especially with the rapid building and overcrowding. We are ALL going to be paying for these storms. So, if you work in insurance or are an insurance agent, what are we looking at for premiums in the 2025 season? We need to have that conversation.
