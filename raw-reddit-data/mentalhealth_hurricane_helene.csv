I lost my childhood home from hurricane Helene. And some venting,"This was originally a post about how I (20M) am worried about becoming a hoarder because everytime I feel comfortable with what I have some disaster takes it all away. Weather it be a house fire, people breaking into our home and stealing everything, people taking my childhood videogames at school, just generally losing things. Or the recent hurricane that flooded our apartment. 

But I have realized I just am really just worried about how all this loss may be affecting me in general. I lost my mom over the summer, and before that I had considered myself pretty strong, I hadn't spent too much time dawdling on the things in my life. But after she passed away it felt like it all just hit at once. I don't feel strong anymore. I try, I tried when I found out about the flooding. I kept telling myself that I'm lucky it wasn't worse that my dad's okay and our pets are fine. That there are people who have it worse. Are living through worse and pushing through. That worked a bit but it just isn't enough. I just feel in shock. I feel like the world isn't real anymore. I am having trouble focusing on my goals and it feels like my brain is rewriting itself. I just don't know what to do. I'm all the way in Charlotte and I can't easily get to my family but even if I was there I feel like I'd be useless. So I want to try and stay strong here but I still feel like it's all pointless. I want to come out of this better but I'm scared I'm not going to recover mentally. It feels like wounds are accumulating in my brain and they aren't healing faster than new ones appear.

And off campus zoom counseling centers. And while I'm sure that can be helpful it just doesn't sit right with me.

Hurricane Helene Emotional Support Thread,"Hi all. I am not a mental health professional, just a person offering an ear to those struggling in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. 

Whether you want someone to vent to, someone to talk through things with, or someone to simply validate what you’re experiencing, I want to help in whatever capacity is most constructive. A hurricane can wash away tangible things—items, a person, a home—but it can erode one’s mind, too. Rebuilding comes in many forms. 

My DMs are open. Perhaps others willing to offer some mental health support can comment here and open their DMs, too.

How can I mourn without being mopey?,"This is a general question which I've pondered for a long time, but I'm going to use current events just as an example. I don't know how to mourn a loss/failure/tragedy/etc. without just falling into a ""depression hole"" where I lose hope and faith in anything and everything.

Current example: I grew up in central North Carolina and my grandparents live in the mountains, about halfway between Boone and Asheville. I have a lot of family in that area and Hurricane Helene has devastated the entire region. As far as I can tell, my extended family are all safe and well, but I see images posted by people of small towns I'm very familiar with which have been basically wiped off the map, and part of me wants to mourn the loss, but when I start to let myself do that, I almost always stop myself because it feels like I'm going to spiral downward and out of control. I have lived in western Arkansas the last few years and as such, the storm did not have any direct effect on me, but I feel like I should - and want to - hurt for the people of WNC.

Again, this is just one example of the overall thing which I've thought about for a long time, but how do you get on with your life? Maybe being a little mopey about a bad situation is okay, but where does it end? If I did that for every bad situation, I'd just spend my entire life crying in bed, and that's no way to live.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1fslj39/how_can_i_mourn_without_being_mopey/,1727664221.0,_otterinabox,mentalhealth,"[{'Comment Author': 'w_crow', 'Comment Body': 'Google ""the grievers bill of rights"" or ""the mourners bill of rights"" and give it a read.\n\nThere\'s a million things in that document that are ""no duh.""

I can’t stop wishing to go home after Helene,"18f. I go to college in western NC, and we were in the direct path of Helene. 

The hurricane was so awful- one of our cities only just now, today, got back food and power. We weren’t prepared, but I was fortunate enough to be able to evacuate the day after the main hurricane aftermath hit, and I’m about 5 hours from home at my parents house. 

I know a lot of people talk about missing your parents, but being here has made me realize just why I left in the first place. We can’t return until the end of October, and im struggling. I’m isolated- high school was hell, I have no connections here anymore. All my friends I did have are in college or working all day/night and so I’ve been completely alone. 

I have no car, no way to go anywhere of substance. I feel so guilty thinking about how I can’t go anywhere or see anyone, even though it has been over a week since I’ve been home. The only time I leave is to walk my street or go to lunch if my mom wants to grab me. 

I know people are dead, and I grieve them. I grieve the people I’ve lost from my university and school placement for my major, and I’ve done everything I can from this distance, but I feel so weighted with frustration and guilt that I’m allowed to feel this way when people have lost their homes, lives, and families. I hate that I feel resentment toward others who could have stayed up there helping out, and yet I know my parents would be worried sick.

Every time I see people I know I just grow resentful. I hate myself, more now than ever. This was the reason I left as to not wallow in self-pity, but I don’t have a choice anymore. I don’t want to end it, I won’t, but yet being back here is the only time it even crosses my mind. 

I know I have a lot of baggage but my emotions right now are so contradictory I don’t know how to feel anything but upset. I just wanna go home, but I don’t deserve to want that.
