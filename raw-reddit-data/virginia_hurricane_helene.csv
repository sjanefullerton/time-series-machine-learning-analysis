VDOT Prepares For Impacts Of Hurricane Helene In Virginia,"Agency ready to address effects of heavy rains, high winds and flooding

The Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) is prepared to address any potential weather impacts of Hurricane Helene, expected to begin impacting the commonwealth tonight, Thursday, Sept. 26.

Impacts from the storm are expected to be felt across the commonwealth, particularly in Southwest and parts of Central Virginia. It may bring heavy rain and strong winds beginning this evening and lasting into Friday. Localized flooding is probable due to recent precipitation, and wind gusts may result in downed trees and powerlines and scattered power outages.

VDOT crews stand ready to respond to road hazards and any damage resulting from the storm. Ahead of the storm, crews have been inspecting drainage facilities and clearing them where necessary, readying trucks and equipment, and coordinating debris and tree removal crews to be on standby.

As forecasts and conditions could change, travelers should pay close attention to local weather reports and announcements from officials and limit their travels based on conditions along their route.

# Safety during the storm

The safety of the traveling public and our crews is VDOT‚Äôs top priority.

Stay away from downed wires and do not approach or touch trees or limbs that are entangled with wires as they could be extremely dangerous. VDOT crews must await the power company to remove any electrical hazard before addressing downed trees or other roadway debris.

Travelers should use extreme caution on roadways:

* Obey all ‚Äúroad closed‚Äù signage.
* If traveling, remember, headlights should always be on when wipers are on.
* If traffic signals are out, drivers should treat intersections as four-way stops or follow local law enforcement‚Äôs direction.
* ‚ÄúTurn around, don‚Äôt drown‚Äù ‚Äî Do not attempt to travel through flooded roadways. Be alert to debris, downed trees and power lines.
* Move over for emergency crews operating in or near roadways.
* Be alert to High Wind Advisories, especially on bridges or taller structures. High-profile vehicles such as tractor trailers, SUVs or box trucks are especially vulnerable and should not cross a bridge when a High Wind Advisory is posted.

# Stay informed

Prior to travel, the public should check road conditions checking the 511 Virginia mobile app, by visiting¬†[511virginia.org](https://www.511virginia.org/).

The public should report any concerns such as flooding, downed trees or road hazards to VDOT‚Äôs 24-hour Customer Service Center by visiting¬†[my.vdot.virginia.gov](https://my.vdot.virginia.gov/)¬†or calling 800-FOR-ROAD (367-7623).

Hurricane Helene roadway recovery efforts continue in Southwest Virginia,"Following the remnants of Hurricane Helene, which pummeled the region with heavy rains and high winds on Friday, the Virginia Department of Transportation‚Äôs (VDOT) Bristol District has worked diligently to re-open approximately 500 roads and removed 11,000 cubic yards of debris.

VDOT crews from the region, contract crews and approximately 200 VDOT employees from around the state have made great strides but a significant amount of work is left to accomplish.

Approximately 75 roads remain impacted, with two being primary highways. Closures are due to downed trees blocking roadways and damages caused by flood waters.

Route 16 near the Smyth/Grayson County line reopened today following pipe repairs.

Main closures include:

* Route 21 in Grayson County near Route 729 and the Town of Independence is closed due to a slide. It is anticipated to take 2-3 weeks to make needed repairs.
* Route 58 through the Town of Damascus is currently closed to through traffic due to recovery efforts.
* Route 58 is closed between the intersection of Route 91 at Damascus and Feather Camp Road in the Konnarock area due to a significant road washout along Route 58.
* Two bridges along Route 725 in the Taylor‚Äôs Valley Community are currently closed due to road washouts adjacent to the bridges. Crews are planning the installation of a temporary bridge near the intersection of Routes 725 and 726 within the week.
* Three bridges were washed away in the storm:
   * The Route 1212 bridge in the Town of Damascus
   * The Route 800 St. Claire‚Äôs Creek Road bridge in Smyth County
   * The Route 859 (Grassy Ridge Road) bridge in the Konnarock area of Washington County.
* Five large pipes are washed out in Grayson County; three on Route 783 (Helton Creek Lane) and two on Route 749 (Cabin Creek).

Workers continue efforts to establish access to routes where trees are downed or where roads were flooded and need to be assessed before reopening.

Virginia hospitals assessing IV fluid shortage post-Helene | A North Carolina facility makes most of the nation's IV fluids! Who knew?,"Hey everyone, it's the VPM News on-call editor for this weekend, and we have something [you might want to read](https://www.vpm.org/news/2024-10-07/intravenous-fluids-shortage-baxter-international-marion-north-carolina).

**Basically: There's now a national IV fluid shortage, and some Virginia hospitals are already rescheduling procedures to triage care.**

Here's what we know so far:

* **UVA Health** is contacting patients undergoing elective procedures for Monday and Tuesday to reschedule them.
* **VCU Health** said it is ""conserving its supply of IV fluid.""
* **HCA Virginia** told us the system has contingency plans to maintain adequate supply, whatever that means.
* We're still waiting to hear from **Bon Secours**. (Please respond to us, Bon Secours!)
* ~~Edited~~ *~~again~~* ~~to add: We've emailed~~ **~~Sentara~~**~~! We forgot to before publishing, oops. We'll update if/when we hear back.~~
* Edited *AGAIN again* to add information from hospitals and health systems in Hampton Roads (thanks to our friends at u/WHRO_News!)
   * **Sentara** said in a statement it doesn't use Baxter International ‚Äî the company with the damaged North Carolina facility ‚Äî for its IV solutions.
   * **Children's Hospital of the King's Daughter** said its supply isn't affected right now.
   * **Chesapeake Regional Medical Center** is conserving IV fluid when possible and working with its supply chain department to identify other options until its regular vendors are available again.
   * **Riverside Health** said it is proactively managing its IV fluid supply to make sure there is no disruption to care, which means patients may receive different fluids when ""clinically appropriate.""

As *the* major IV fluid manufacturing facility near Asheville has been closed with no timeline for reopening, there's no obvious timeline for the end of this shortage.

**Edit:** Baxter International said in a [Wednesday press release](https://www.baxter.com/baxter-newsroom/hurricane-helene-updates) that its goal was to ""return to 90% to 100% allocation of certain IV solution product codes"" by the end of the year. We're reading that as ""we are going to restart production of certain IV fluids, but we're not telling you/we don't know which ones yet."" (If you can parse out what this means, please feel free to pitch us on an explainer series about deciphering corporate communications.)

The post-Helene efforts have also activated the [Virginia Healthcare Emergency Management Program](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/emergency-preparedness/hospital-healthcare-preparedness/), which means the call/email list on that VDH page has been mobilized to do things.

Note: [NPR wrote and aired](https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/2024-10-04/storm-damage-closes-marion-nc-factory-hospital-supplies) a thing about it too, but it's not localized for y'all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Virginia/comments/1fxrv4a/virginia_hospitals_assessing_iv_fluid_shortage/,1728251326.0,vpmnews,Virginia,"[{'Comment Author': 'None', 'Comment Body': '[deleted]'}, {'Comment Author': 'robokai', 'Comment Body': 'You would think after hurricane Maria they would have redundancy in manufacturing.'}, {'Comment Author': 'None', 'Comment Body': 'What about Riverside Health System and CHKD?\xa0'}, {'Comment Author': 'CurlyQ-', 'Comment Body': 'Anyone have any feedback on Fredericksburg area / central VA ?'}, {'Comment Author': 'Delicious-Badger-906', 'Comment Body': 'Remember all that talk early on in COVID about how our supply chains are too fragile and we need more redundancy?\n\nI thought we‚Äôd learned from that!

"Okay to got on Arbnb vacation in west region of VA?
","Hi guys,

Question: My family we were originally planning to book an Airbnb in the western NC mountains (near Boone). Obviously, we had to cancel due to Hurricane Helene. I found an Airbnb a bit farther north, in Virginia, between Mouth of Wilson and Independence. The host informed me that their house did very well and that they were outside the eye of the storm, with only some downed trees.

I was planning to go on October 11 (next week). Do you think it‚Äôs appropriate to go there? I mean, would it be better to stay out of the area for the sake of the recovery efforts? I‚Äôm really wondering how bad the situation is there if people should avoid visiting. Or would it be okay to support the business in that area?

For those unfamiliar with Andrea, she spent the majority of her career as a journalist working for ABC (I think) (network) and local DC television stations. She's now at PenFed and has raised what seems like a gazillion of the cutest pups to be service animals. She's an amazing advocate for veterans and the value service animals bring to their lives. I'm proud to have known her since high school. She kicks ass. So do what you can to help the pups and kitties.
