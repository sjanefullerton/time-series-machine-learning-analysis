The governor of the state in which the disaster occurs must declare a state of emergency and formally request from the President that FEMA and the federal government respond to the disaster. If one asks why the assistance has to be requested instead of automatically given, the answer is because states have their own governments and response agencies. Once those agencies say, ""This is more than we can handle,"" is when FEMA comes in to assist. \n\nFEMA has a limited budget ($20.26 billion in 2024), so it has to try as much as possible to make that money last for the entire year. To put that into perspective, the estimated cost of recovery for Hurricane Helene is currently around $48 billion - almost 2.5 times FEMA\'s entire budget. \n\nConsidering climate change has increased the frequency and intensity of hurricanes and will likely continue to do so, FEMA\'s budget should be much higher. However, Republicans (100 in total including Gaetz and Cruz, who both represent constituents in states that rely ***heavily*** on FEMA funding assistance) recently voted ***against*** a stop-gap measure to increase FEMA\'s budget. \n\nSpeaking specifically to this topic, the amount FEMA distributes has to be requested and is intended to provide *emergency* assistance to help people stay alive (e.g. food, housing, medical ..) and not to provide the total cost if recovery. That is the role of homeowners or renters insurance. The big problem here is MAGA republicans (the very people whose states lean on FEMA more than any others) are spreading misinformation (see: lies) to discredit FEMA\'s role as a provider in order to deface Harris. They are endangering their own constituents for political gain. Because of their misinformation (see: lies), people are not actually requesting the assistance that is there for their use. Please keep that in mind when/if you vote this year. \n\nOn a side note, as of yesterday, FEMA has actually spent $281 million responding to this hurricane alone, and Milton is about to roll through too. \n\nI hope this information helps, and I hope you hold your elected officials (no matter who they are) accountable. We must not let politicians lie to us and further expand the power imbalance that is so important to them. Please learn about the people running for office in your areas and vote, vote, vote.
