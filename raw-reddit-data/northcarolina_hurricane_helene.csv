Quick Update on the Biden-Harris Administration‚Äôs Response to Hurricane Helene.,"We‚Äôre continuing to surge resources to North Carolina to make sure communities have everything they need to recover and rebuild. So far:  
- FEMA has approved more than $37 million in assistance for over 28,000 households  
- More than 1,000 FEMA staff are on the ground, with more arriving daily  
- Over 1,200 Urban Search and Rescue personnel remain in the field. So far, these teams have rescued or supported over 3,200 survivors  
- More than 2,100 people are staying in safe and clean lodging through FEMA‚Äôs hotel program  
- 18 shelters are housing just under 800 occupants  
- More than 86% of originally reported power outages have been restored  
- President Biden ordered an additional 500 active-duty troops to the area, bringing the total number of active-duty military personnel supporting the response in North Carolina to 1,500  
- FEMA Disaster Survivor Assistance Teams remain on the ground to help survivors apply for FEMA assistance and connect them with additional state, local, federal, and voluntary agency resources  
  
Our Administration will be here for as long as it takes. We encourage survivors to apply for FEMA assistance, which can be done by:

Large government organizations DO tend to be slow and regulation-bound, and many government policies are stupid and should be changed. ON THE OTHER HAND a lot of these rumors are insane and damaging. FEMA\'s going to steal Chimney Rock to mine lithium, the government is purposely blocking help just to hurt people and make them suffer, etc. I\'m sure that some group from some NGO was told at some point not to enter a specific area, but details matter, such as what they were offering and where they were trying to go. I have seen pictures from people I know personally of items like clothes and stuffed animals that well-meaning people have collected and trucked to donation sites near the hard-hit areas that are just having to be discarded because they\'re cluttering up the sites and making it harder to get people things like water. Not all help is equally helpful, and yes, you can make things worse even if you have good intentions. FEMA or the National Guard trying to keep outside people from making things worse is not, in and of itself, sinister.

Quick Update on the Biden-Harris Administration‚Äôs Response to Hurricane Helene.,"Our Administration continues to work around the clock to make sure communities in North Carolina have everything they need to recover and rebuild. So far:  
- FEMA has approved more than $60 million in assistance for over 51,000 households  
- More than 1,000 FEMA staff are on the ground, with more arriving daily  
- 1,200 Urban Search and Rescue personnel are in the field, supporting over 3,200 survivors  
- 17 shelters are housing just under 800 occupants  
- More than 90% of originally reported power outages have been restored  
- More than 2,600 people are staying in safe and clean lodging through FEMA‚Äôs hotel program  
  
Our Administration will not leave until the job is done. We encourage survivors to apply for FEMA assistance, which can be done by:

This storm, combined with the rain system that moved down from the northwest right before it, created something we\'ve never tracked in written history. \n\n100 year flood, 500 year, 1000 year; they are all averages that haven\'t taken into account how much climate levels have changed in a relatively short amount of time. \n\nFEMA, as an organization and government entity, is intended to be the national level guidance for preparedness. In its simplistic form, it is there to guide policy, best practice, preparedness, mitigation (think building code, not emergency response), recovery, and *support* response. It has the power to fund recovery through emergency disaster acts. Note, this is a VERY simplified explanation of the Federal Emergency Management Agency!\n\nHere\'s how it works: \n\nDay to day emergencies, like car wrecks and house fires, are handled by local folks. \n\nDisasters occur when the local folks are overwhelmed.\n\nLive in a one stop-light town with a single police officer, volunteer fire department, and no paramedic ambulance? You can hit disaster pretty quick. \n\nLive in a suburban area where your town, and the towns around you have dozens of cops, firefighters, and ambulances? ""Disaster"" can be absorbed with a little help from your friends. \n\nLive in a Megatropolis with hundreds of cops, firefighters, and ambulances? Disaster is far removed. \n\nCatastrophe happens when local AND regional resources are overwhelmed. \n\n1000 year flood that cripples 1\\4 of the 9th largest state in the country? Catastrophe. Period. Stop. End of story. \n\nWhat we are facing is a catastrophic event with the largest mobilization of resources since September 11th, 2001 (also a catastrophe if measured by the above criteria alone, not taking into account the international ramifications, FYI) \n\nFEMA\'s purpose is to create guides, tools, structures, etc. to help state, tribal, county\\regional, and municipal governments plan, prepare, mitigate, and respond to ""day to day"" emergencies without outside help, ""disasters"" with limited or very focused outside help, and catastrophic events with the full help of everyone. And to do the planning, preparing, mitigating, and responding from the same playbook\n\nAlong with all of this, there are phases to a disaster \\ catastrophe response. Life safety, as in actively saving of lives, is the first phase, and all resources possible are dedicated to it. First by the local response (community fire house), then regional resources, (next station or county resources closest), then state, interstate, so on. \n\nRecovery comes next, and can be a part of response, but it can, and will, take YEARS. Initial recovery can coincide with rescue. While state rescue teams are searching houses, energy contractors are getting the lights back on. Fire tankers are supplying the hospital HVAC plants with water. It\'s a complex symphony of actions. \n\nPreparedness and mitigation can go hand in hand, but they are different. Preparedness says, \'we have flooding, I want the local fire station to be ready to respond to floods.\' Mitigation says, \'we have flooding, let\'s change our building and land use codes so our citizens aren\'t in danger and their property will not be destroyed. \n\nTo the original question, I can try and get a list started to address all the ""responders"" from within the state, and all those my guys worked with, but I know I\'ll miss some folks. \n\nI can say, that within two days, Orange County had over 50 emergency responders \\ officials dedicated to WNC (not counting NCNG members since we don\'t have a guard unit technically). Larger populated counties sent more. A few sent less. If we go off of averages though, let\'s say 25 of NC\'s counties have been impacted in this catastrophe. If the remaining 75 counties sent 40 people each, that means over 3000 NC responders were in, or operating on behalf of, the 25 impacted counties. That is a huge number. It\'s 120 responders per county. That doesn\'t even address the guard units, and interstate agencies, volunteer organizations, etc. \n\n Let that sink in.'}, {'Comment Author': 'Valdaraak', 'Comment Body': ""Yep, that's one of the downfalls you just have to accept when you live in the middle of nowhere.

The REAL people rescuing, saving lives, and delivering supplies are locals, folks in the national guard, churches, private organizations. I will give FEMA the credit due for aiding in the organization of recovery efforts, and aiding in helping to eventually pay for recovery for many, but FEMA claiming credit for the recovery efforts is a bit misleading.\n\nIf we compare the response to Hurricane Katrina, which George Bush was roundly criticized for, there was a 3-Star active Duty General in command of a massive response effort. A joint task force was established that started with around 3000 active duty troops, and grew to over 14,000 within four days of landfall. Ultimately, over 50,000 National Guardsmen were mobilized. That\'s not to mention the  naval vessels and Coast Guard.  The resources brought to bear by an active duty commander, higher in rank, would provide muscle, communications, rescue and recovery, and would essentially ""surge"" the resources for coordinating the ongoing rescue and recovery efforts. \n\nRight now, it took Biden four days to deploy ANY active military, and even then only about 1500 troops altogether. Add in another 1500 guard troops deployed by Cooper and we are a looking at a command of about 3000 troops total. They are being commanded by a one star national guard general. No offense to that general, but a one star does not bring the resources of a 3 star. Even Hurricane Maria had a 3 star in charge of the recovery task force for Puerto Rico. \n\nThis is a thousand year weather event, affecting a land mass the size of Massachusetts and hundreds of thousands of people. The devastation is unlike anything we have ever seen.\n\nSo...if you think the response has been great and perfect, that\'s your prerogative. \n\nI think that the efforts of those that are ""boots on the ground"" have been absolutely heroic, whether they be locals, FEMA, Active Duty, National Guard, churches, organizations, or individuals. The work that so many are putting in and sacrifice that so many have made are truly to be admired and applauded. There is nothing that should take away from shining a spotlight on their effort. However, the federal and state response to activate so few military personal, who are truly those best equipped to traverse the terrain, coordinate rescue, recovery, and relief efforts, help put a face to the recovery, provide medical, logistical, communications, and coordination...our leaders have been sorely lacking in their response by neglecting to call up more troops and put more effort into helping our neighbors that have been devastated.\n\nWe can praise that efforts that are taking place, AND criticize the leadership that has been slow to surge resources that would greatly expedite the relief and recovery effort.

This means the coordination of a mass response of federal resources from a single staging point was not practical.  Further complicating the WNC disaster is lack of communications due to cell towers being offline.   These two factors meant that local responders were best positioned to determine priorities and resource requirements with information funneling down to state and local emergency response teams to coordinate the appropriate responses.\n\nIf thousands of troops show up, where would they go.  How would their efforts be coordinated, where would their fuel and supplies come from to support such a mass force...etc... etc...\n\nThe real heros are the local response teams.

STOP SPREADING MISINFORMATION,"UPDATE: 10/4/2024 8:20PM EDT

There are scammers profiting off our crisis here in North Carolina in a highly coordinated effort. They are utilizing a rapidly evolving disinformation campaign to influence public opinion and solicit donations of money. There are entire networks of [scam websites](https://www.manganesexenergycorp.com/manganese-a-substitute-for-lithium-ion-batteries/), [scam charities](https://americanyellowcross.org/MOBILE/Partners.aspx), and fake social media profiles dedicated to this effort. Not to sound alarmist or conspiracy theorist myself, but there's a non zero chance this may be a cyber attack from a foreign nation. 

If so, our nation is being targeted in the midst of a major national disaster. They are targeting well meaning individuals who want to help victims of the disaster. They are advocating for civil unrest and calling for violence against the first responders deployed in the disaster area. 

Do not travel to Western North Carolina with the intentions of attacking your fellow Americans.

If you hear someone talking about traveling to WNC with the intent to cause harm or create civil unrest, notify authorities immediately.

Know that the goal of this apparent attack, is to maximize the suffering and death of Americans affected by what may be the worst natural disaster in US history.

If you come across donation links for hurricane victims on social media, specifically Facebook, verify that the profile who originally posted the link is a real person. Ask a close family member for a second opinion. Do not donate money to these pages. Report the profile for: Spam or Violence. Select the option to send the report to Meta. 

If you have donated money to one of these scam links, dispute it with your bank. Your financial information has likely been compromised.

If you are unsure about a website or need a second opinion to verify your sources, feel free to reach out.

‚Äî-

Challenge misinformation online wherever you see it. Be a calm voice of reason. State facts. Try not to get too heated. This kind of rhetoric is dangerous.

‚Äî‚Äî



**1. Don‚Äôt evacuate because the government is going to steal your land to mine lithium!**

That‚Äôs not a thing. Hypothetically, if the government DID want your land (they don‚Äôt), they wouldn't need all these layers of conspiracy to take it. They can invoke eminent domain and must compensate you for the property. This is basic constitutional law (5th amendment). Again, that isn't happening. Anyone telling folks not to evacuate doesn‚Äôt have their best interests at heart.

**2. FEMA is confiscating/destroying/hoarding supplies and turning away help.**

They‚Äôre telling people where to drop off supplies and asking untrained individuals not to self deploy. Going out there alone without training or equipment makes you a liability no matter how good your intentions are.

**3. The government isn‚Äôt helping!**

The government is helping. They have been since day 1. The best trained rescue technicians in the nation are working around the clock. National Guard is there. 82nd Airborne is there. Air Force & Civil Air Patrol. NC Highway Patrol. FEMA. All the politicians have come and gone. The reason why it‚Äôs taking so long to reach those in need is because this is a MASSIVE disaster spanning hundreds of miles, several states, and millions of people. So far, this is the 3rd largest mobilization of federal resources behind 9/11 and Katrina.

**4. We need to rise up against FEMA!**

Why would anyone want to harm the people who are helping? Why would anyone advocate for any act that would disrupt search and rescue operations? FEMA is not our enemy and never has been. They're average folks just like us who genuinely want to help others.

**5. Fort Liberty is being told to stand down. They're denying soldiers leave**

82nd Airborne has been deployed to WNC. Soldiers were likely told they could not use personal leave to self deploy.

UPDATE: I‚Äôve been informed: ‚ÄúLeave is being allowed, but local (within geographical region) only IF that person is in an alert status. Otherwise, they're free to request leave.‚Äù

**6. Federal officials ordered Chimney Rock to be bulldozed**

Never happened. [Debunked by the town.](https://www.wcnc.com/article/weather/hurricane/helene/chimney-rock-bulldozed-helene/275-54741b10-7482-4116-ac38-98bff585b6e6)

**7. FEMA is running out of money because Kamala spent it all on housing illegal migrants**

This is a great source from [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/04/trump-fema-claim-debunked-agency-not-running-out-of-money-because-of-migrants/) disproving that

What you see/hear from the news media is1/50th of it. I have done hurricane relief and as an amateur radio operator, I have heard myself the issues being presented. Water treatment facilities that have to be completely rebuilt-nothing to repair. Roads and power lines on sides of mountains completely gone (miles and miles of them), towns, bridges, roads, homes, stores, etc gone. The loss of life in the end will be high. On top of all of this, there are low-life scum bags going in and looting, destroying and being vigilantes. Local and state officials are trying to stop and prevent this from continuing. One way to do this is by limiting individual self deployment into the area. As others have mentioned, locals helping locals is different from John Doe from the city that has a chainsaw going in and cutting stuff down. Locals know each other and the area. No one knows who John Doe is, what his skills are and where he is/what he is doing. Imaging 25 guys riding in and they start cutting trees down and cause a landslide that wipes out a distribution point below them or get caught in it. If you want to help, go through an organization (church, local aid organization, etc) and have them coordinate with the county they can get to for direction and to be allowed in. Large agencies (Walmart, Lowes, etc) already have contact information for them to be allowed in and can get assistance getting them to where they are needed. This is not an overnight fix. This is going to take a long time. Think back to hurricane Andrew in Miami, Katrina or any other disaster.\n\nIf you come across someone spreading disinformation, let others/authorities know so it can be stopped. If you know of price gouging or other criminal activity, let the authorities know. These things can help those effected. Verify who you are donating to as well. \n\nThere are a LOT of unsung hero's out there as well-the guy that heard of an elderly couple he didn't know that needed emergency evacuation and rode a horse to help clear a landing field for evac, the guy that risked his life swimming across a swiftly moving creek to help a lady whose house was sliding down a hill, the guys that hiked 15 miles in to help get a group out.

(We\'re from Asheville but had just moved less than 2 hours out, to work a new job AND be able to go in & out of Asheville for the work we do there, too.) Thankfully out of the mess but have been posting evac routes and whatever resources we found, gathering supplies, etc. since we had signal.\n\n\nHere\'s some info I have received from people in the area, and some info from family friends that tried to go in too:\n\n-Friends in the area are getting ""scared to say too much"" telling me to be careful who I trust and idk what that\'s all supposed to mean. These are people who do not give in to ""theories"". \n\n-Rejecting anyone that can\'t prove they live there, out of state tags, etc. even rejecting the supplies they are coming with (similarly complicated situation that happened in Puerto Rico it feels like) meaning we haven\'t been allowed in either bc our proof of rent and paystubs were lost in the flood. \n\n-Pictures of immigration trucks patrolling the area, why? \n\n-Denial of mass truck loads of supplies from those in NC and even those driving from out of state [family and friends of mine were threatened to leave, not just asked] (I understand protecting their safety but they wouldn\'t even take the supplies, and they come back in fear, saying don\'t even go there and won\'t say anything else) \n\n-We have applied to many of the organizations and communities seeking help, messages read but no reply. Applications denied. And we are equipped with unique, life saving gear that could help (battery/solar power, Lifesaver Jerrycan for ultra-purification filtration of water without need to boil, a large vehicle to transport multiple at once, barrels of dry clothes, etc) but, again, they read and don\'t reply, or outright deny it. Then we hear what I listed above. \n\n-That\'s just some of what we\'ve been hearing all week, not to mention the lack of exposure. \n\n\nThis is our home, our place, our people, and with what we\'ve been hearing we can\'t help but feel like something is off..\n\nSomeone, please, help me understand some of these things so I can call it out, confirm or not if they are untrue, and even find a better way to get in and help. It isn\'t a hero complex type of thing for us, we lost a lot and are trying to recover not just our people but our needed items that might *possibly* have made it. With what we have gone through outside of this disaster, all we have left is a burning need to help our people. \n\nIf all this we\'ve heard (from even family that never believed in conspiracy type things) is not true, please confirm and help me understand. I can share the information and this may help us find a way to help even more. I want to do this right. \n\nI do not mean to offend anyone and I only want what is best, and help my people that are still there be safe and survive.\n\nEdit: the list did that thing where it smushed together, I can\'t recall the fix so I added returns to space them out.

Every time I went back after that, my gun went with me and if I had to leave after dark or if something suspicious was happening, I called the Police Chief on his personal cell phone and I got an escort.\n\nI can't tell you why there are sick individuals like this in the world, but there are and they are very dangerous. If someone says online that they were denied FEMA assistance but they are in a damaged area, 99% they are lying. There will be many that didn't even have a leaf fall in their yard that will apply (happens every disaster) and they will be denied. Also if someone is posting online they didn't get help, no one is coming to save them, etc.. That is automatically questionable. First, they have internet and electricity. Second, they have been flooded and trapped for days and somehow their phone is charged (could happen, battery packs are a thing) and they could have cell service, but would they be spending that time getting on social media while their home is underwater? Not likely.\n\nIt's sad, but I automatically assume posts like that are a lie if and until they can show proof of their claims. And I mean real proof, not something Trump said.""}, {'Comment Author': 'JohnnyPotseed', 'Comment Body': 'I can‚Äôt believe I had to type any part of this post in all seriousness in the year 2024.'}, {'Comment Author': 'detail_giraffe', 'Comment Body': 'Could you agree with ""anyone telling folks not to evacuate because the government is going to steal their land doesn\'t have their best interests at heart""?'}, {'Comment Author': 'JohnnyPotseed', 'Comment Body': 'Obviously you‚Äôre free to choose, but no one should be emotionally manipulated into staying behind out of fear they may lose their property, which simply isn‚Äôt true.'}, {'Comment Author': 'JohnnyPotseed', 'Comment Body': 'No you didn‚Äôt.

Parts of the road were washed away, she felt her car slipping off the road multiple times, literally feared for her life and wondered if she was going to see her daughter again, and the worst part:\n\n> I even had to drive through what used to be a stream which is now small river that had overtaken a bridge. It took me a while to get the courage to drive through it because I couldn‚Äôt see the bottom and wasn‚Äôt sure how deep it was or how safe it was to drive through. I had to wait on someone else obviously more familiar with the area to go through first for reassurance I could make it in my little Kia. \n\nAnd at no point did the thought ""I should turn around and go home"" win over.\n\nShe has since made an update about how she was reckless and it was dangerous, she was concerned about the wellbeing of her employees and was taking them supplies, etc. She has, at least, refused to share the route she took and discouraged others from doing what she did. But there are hundreds or thousands of people right now thinking ""that won\'t happen to me,"" ""I\'ll be fine,"" ""I\'m a good driver,"" ""I have AWD,"" etc. and packing up their little load of well-intentioned donations to personally deliver to some inaccessible town because ""the government isn\'t helping them.""'}, {'Comment Author': 'devinhedge', 'Comment Body': 'You can follow the drama on the Mount Mitchell repeater.

Even a few inches of standing water can cause an accident. \n\nYou also have to know how to drive in flooding.\n\nI grew up at the beach, and one night when I was 15, it was storming really hard so my dad came to the restaurant where I worked to pick me up. He had a suburban that was a lot heavier than my mom‚Äôs late 80s minivan. The vehicle is also higher off the ground. \n\nHe told me to drive. He said I needed to know how to drive in high water conditions since we lived in an area that gets a lot of tropical depressions/storms/hurricanes. He got me used to driving in the pouring rain then had me drive in the right lane where there was standing water. He‚Äôd just driven on that road in that lane, and he didn‚Äôt have me drive on it until he saw other cars drive through it successfully. \n\nThe water pulls the tires to the right so you have to learn how to turn the wheel against the water while also not over correcting. He told me to never trust a pool of standing water because you don‚Äôt know how deep it is. We used to live on a gravel road, and after a hurricane my dad had me drive down there. We parked in our old driveway then walked over to the pot holes that had standing water. He had a big stick and showed me how deep the hole was. It was much deeper than it used to be. \n\nAfter that we would watch the tv footage from storms and see how people got stuck in big pools of standing water or got pulled off bridges. \n\nMy dad was former law enforcement and had gone to car accidents where people got pulled off roads or got stuck in deep pools of water. He was also an officer in the 70s when accidents were more likely to be fatal. He wouldn‚Äôt let me get my drivers license until he knew that I could drive in all conditions. Another thing my parents focused on teaching is how to get your car back on the road if a wheel goes off the edge onto the shoulder without over correcting. That‚Äôs a big cause of accidents on two lane highways especially for new drivers.

Lastly, the government in generally messed up on warning people of the magnitude of this hurricanes effect on that area to get people out or to higher ground. Also they failed to respond fast enough; like it or not, it took way too long for FEMA's response to help in the area until it was too late and around 200 people have died. Florida's national guard reported that they got there and people were wondering where the hella FEMA and others were. 750 dollars to people who have lost everything is a joke, not to mention the difficulties that people are having to actually access the funds. \n\nOverall this is a massive fail by the Harris admin. Bush was railed for Katrina, but you can argue this is even worse. Bush was not spending all the disaster relief money on illegal migrants whose root cause he caused. Also Harris and FEMA had the benefit of hindsight on that and still dropped the ball.

Donations for Hurricane Helene Victims Were 'Ransacked' from Church,"HENDERSON COUNTY, S.C. (WSPA) ‚Äî The pastor of a church in Henderson County said that their stockpile of donations for Hurricane Helene victims was ‚Äúransacked,‚Äù but it won‚Äôt stop their efforts to help those in need.

‚ÄúWe have several people in our church where their house is totally gone,‚Äù Pastor at Fruitland Baptist Church, Chris Pace said.

Church officials said in the days following the storm, their church along with Fruitland Baptist Bible College, teamed up to collect supplies for community members in need.

‚ÄúA gentleman drove all the way from Kentucky yesterday and brought some very essential items we have been looking for, like tarps and construction bags, and when I say ‚Äòbring some items‚Äô it was an entire U-Haul of them,‚Äù Pace said.

Director of Campus Facilities Fruitland Baptist Bible College, Bobby Garrett, said that they received donations from across the country.

‚ÄúWe had just such a gracious outpouring of the region, from all over the southeast, we had donations come in from Indiana, \[and\] from Mesa, Arizona,‚Äù Garrett said.

Church and college officials said some people decided to take advantage of the generosity. Donations that were ready for distribution were ransacked.

‚ÄúWe had it \[happened\] three nights, we had to pull in security. Now, we are having to pay security out of budget to prevent that from happening,‚Äù Garrett said. ‚ÄúIt happens predominantly at night. There were 50 cars of looters. It was more of a mob type atmosphere here and it was really sad to see humanity stoop to that level.‚Äù

Despite the setback, officials said the work they are doing will continue.

‚ÄúFor a minute there I was in a dark place, because I would have given you that, I would have loaded your car. That does not detract from the fact that there are a lot of good people that have needs,‚Äù Pace added.¬†‚ÄúWhen I am sitting there and I have the chance to pray with someone because they haven‚Äôt got gas, they haven‚Äôt had propane and they are sitting there crying because I gave them a can of propane, I am going to stop because of one bad person when I see that?‚Äù

Pace said a once-in-a-lifetime disaster may be able to tear down buildings and trees, but it‚Äôs not strong enough to wipe away the resilience of his community.¬†

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have to do a relief effort, but we get to and that‚Äôs the attitude we have to have,‚Äù Pace said. ‚ÄúThere are people that lost everything that are going to keep going, so I am going to keep going, our church and community is going to keep going.‚Äù¬†

No, Biden didn‚Äôt take FEMA relief money to use on migrants ‚Äî but Trump did

Donald Trump falsely accuses President Biden of redirecting disaster funds, a budget maneuver Trump himself approved in 2019.

‚ÄúThe Harris-Biden administration says they don‚Äôt have any money [for hurricane relief]. ‚Ä¶ They spent it all on illegal migrants. ‚Ä¶ They stole the FEMA money just like they stole it from a bank, so they could give it to their illegal immigrants that they want to have vote for them.‚Äù

‚Äî Former president Donald Trump, remarks at a campaign rally in Saginaw, Mich., Oct. 3 Trump has been trying to weaponize the Hurricane Helene relief efforts, accusing the Biden administration of failing to provide adequate assistance. As part of his critique, he claims that there is no money available for hurricane relief because it was spent already to handle the surge of migrants at the southern border.

‚ÄúThey stole the FEMA money just like they stole it from a bank,‚Äù Trump charged, referring to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, adding in the additional falsehood that Vice President Kamala Harris wants illegal immigrants to vote for her. As we have explained many times before, this would be against the law and there is no evidence to support this claim. Trump‚Äôs claims have been echoed by his supporters, such as billionaire Elon Musk. But Trump is completely wrong. ‚úÖ

Follow Fact-checking politicians

Even though Trump was once president, he still appears to have little clue about the appropriations process. What‚Äôs even richer is that when he was president, he did exactly what he claims Biden did ‚Äî take money from FEMA‚Äôs disaster fund to fund migrant programs at the southern border.

The Facts

FEMA is part of the Department of Homeland Security. On Wednesday, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters: ‚ÄúWe are meeting the immediate needs with the money that we have. We are expecting another hurricane hitting. FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season.‚Äù He emphasized there was plenty of money to deal with the current disaster. ‚ÄúWe are meeting the moment,‚Äù he said, adding: ‚ÄúWe have the immediate needs right now. On a continuing resolution, we have funds, but that is not a stable source of supply, if you will.‚Äù

Congress, as part of a short-term spending bill, recently provided $20 billion to the FEMA disaster relief fund. But Mayorkas noted: ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt speak about the future and the fact, as I mentioned earlier, that these extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and severity, and we have to be funded for the sake of the American people. This is not a political issue.‚Äù

In other words, Trump falsely claimed that there is no money left for Hurricane Helene survivors. That‚Äôs the opposite of what Mayorkas said.

‚ÄúFEMA has what it needs for immediate response and recovery efforts,‚Äù FEMA spokeswoman Jaclyn Rothenberg said on X. ‚ÄúAs FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell has said, she has the full authority to spend against the President‚Äôs budget, but we‚Äôre not out of hurricane season yet so we need to keep a close eye on it. We may need to go back into immediate needs funding and we will be watching it closely.‚Äù So how does Trump link this to migrants? A Trump campaign spokesman pointed to FEMA‚Äôs Shelter and Services Program, which gives grants to local governments and nonprofits to take care of undocumented immigrants. Congress boosted the budget from $360 million in fiscal year 2023 to $650 million in fiscal year 2024. The program‚Äôs 2023 annual report says it provides shelter, such as hotel/motel services, food and transportation, including plane tickets up to $700 a person. As we said, Congress appropriated this money, just as it did the disaster fund. There‚Äôs no evidence that any money from the disaster fund was used to help migrants.

‚ÄúThese claims are completely false,‚Äù DHS said in a statement Thursday night. ‚ÄúAs Secretary Mayorkas said, FEMA has the necessary resources to meet the immediate needs associated with Hurricane Helene and other disasters. The Shelter and Services Program (SSP) is a completely separate, appropriated grant program that was authorized and funded by Congress and is not associated in any way with FEMA‚Äôs disaster-related authorities or funding streams.‚Äù

Trump has a habit of assuming other politicians act in the same way as he would. So we wondered why he would accuse Biden of raiding the FEMA disaster fund to handle undocumented migrants.

It turns out that‚Äôs because he did this! In 2019, the Trump administration, in the middle of hurricane season, told Congress that it was taking $271 million from DHS programs, including $155 million from the disaster fund, to pay for immigration detention space and temporary hearing locations for asylum seekers who have been forced to wait in Mexico. ‚ÄúThe U.S. is facing a security and humanitarian crisis on the Southern border,‚Äù the administration said in its notice that it was redirecting the funds. The monthly reports issued by the FEMA disaster fund show $38 million was plucked and given to Immigration and Customs Enforcement in August that year ‚Äî just before the prime storm period of September and October. The Trump campaign did not respond to questions about Trump‚Äôs actions in 2019.

The Pinocchio Test

Trump falsely claims FEMA has run out of disaster money ‚Äî and then falsely says that‚Äôs because money instead was spent on migrants. There is no evidence the Biden administration spent FEMA disaster money on migrants. Rather, that‚Äôs what Trump did.

He earns Four Pinocchios.

"It's our future North Carolina, Ignore MAGA lies and weigh the facts carefully.","# It turns out the report of a truckload of armed militia hunting FEMA workers was untrue; it was only one man, but it clearly shows how unjustified conspiracy rumors can spread and do real damage. And where do most of those conspiracy theories originate? With Trump and his MAGA horde.

Trump, in his insatiable lust for power couldn't care less about the harm he does or the people he hurts -- here is clear proof of that. There is no justification for him and MAGA to disparage the necessary work of FEMA, work to save lives and restore property, as is their mandate from our government.

But Trump works at cross purposes to our government, and with lies, lies, and more lies, sows dissention, hatred, and division, and does everything in his power to separate us from our government so he can swoop in and implement his MAGA Manifesto, Project 2025.

He wanted to implement the Insurrection Act, an Act that would give him complete dictatorial powers, but was thwarted by the Justice Department when he was president. Now Project 2025 will give him the power to dismantle the Justice Department and enable him to acquire complete governmental control.

Think carefully about your country when you cast your ballot.

See this -- boldface mine.

As communities across the Southeast, most notably in¬†**North Carolina,**¬†worked to recover from Hurricane Helene and its aftermath,¬†**Donald Trump spent much of last week brazenly lying**¬†about the governmental response to the deadly storm. State and local officials, including plenty of Republicans, asked him to¬†**stop deceiving the public.**¬†He ignored the appeals. Indeed, the¬†**misinformation and disinformation campaigns are ongoing.**¬†As recently as the weekend, Fox News‚Äô Maria Bartiromo asked the former president whether he believes relief funds were transferred from FEMA to ‚Äúillegal immigrants.‚Äù The Republican insisted that this happened, adding that the evidence to bolster his claims were released by the White House.

**None of this happened in reality.**

Nevertheless, as my MSNBC colleague Clarissa-Jan Lim has explained, officials have said that¬†**Trump‚Äôs election season lies and conspiracy theories have hindered relief efforts**, while forcing agencies to¬†**waste time and resources**¬†combatting lies that too many people are falling for. But as it turns out, there‚Äôs reason to believe there are¬†**other consequences,**¬†which are every bit as dramatic. The Washington Post reported: Federal emergency response personnel on Saturday had employees operating in hard-hit Rutherford County, N.C., stop working and move to a different area because of concerns over ‚Äúarmed militia‚Äù threatening government workers in the region, according to an email sent to federal agencies helping with response in the state. It‚Äôs difficult to say just how serious the threat might‚Äôve been, but according to the Post‚Äôs report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, it was midday Saturday when officials involved in Hurricane Helene recovery efforts received an urgent message.

It reportedly warned that ‚ÄúFEMA has advised all federal responders Rutherford County, NC\*\*, to stand down and evacuate the county immediately.\*\* The message stated that National Guard troops ‚Äòhad come across x2 trucks of armed militia saying there were out hunting FEMA.‚Äô‚Äù The email went on to say that incident management team ‚Äúhave been notified and are coordinating the evacuation of all assigned personnel in that county.‚Äù In other words,¬†**Trump and too many of his allies have falsely accused FEMA**¬†and other federal agencies of neglecting places such as Rutherford County, N.C., while in reality, FEMA and other federal agencies are on the ground, providing relief.

At least, they were, until they reportedly had to be ‚Äúevacuated‚Äù for their own safety ‚Äî not because of unsafe conditions related to the deadly storm, but rather due to concerns that armed extremists might harm them.

Fortunately, the teams returned to work a day later, but that doesn‚Äôt make the circumstances any less breathtaking. Indeed, the Post‚Äôs report documented several related incidents involving¬†**threats directed at FEMA as a result of outlandish conspiracy theories.**¬†It was against this backdrop that ABC News‚Äô Martha Raddatz asked Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance about Trump‚Äôs Helena-related lies.

**‚ÄúPeople are worried that their government doesn‚Äôt care about them,**‚Äù the Ohio senator responded.

Perhaps so, but if people in the area of ‚Äúworried,‚Äù it might have something to do with the fact that his running mate and likeminded conspiracy theories lie on a daily basis about the hurricane and the federal response. It‚Äôs twisted reasoning:¬†**Trump and his allies lie, and many believe him. Asked**¬†about the lies,¬†**Vance**¬†points to the concerns of those who put their¬†**faith in a man who deceived them,**¬†as if their fears necessarily have merit, reality be damned.

It‚Äôs the precise logic we saw in the wake of the 2020 election, when Republicans pointed to polls showing a significant number of Americans believed conspiracy theories related to the race‚Äôs outcome. When Democrats pointed to reality, GOP officials effectively replied, ‚ÄúBut look at all of these people who believe otherwise!‚Äù

Pointing to the beliefs of those who‚Äôve been lied to does not make the beliefs true.

You don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs strange behavior to say you ‚ÄúHATE‚Äù someone or demonize anyone who simply disagrees with you? That‚Äôs presidential behavior to you? He blamed moderators in a debate for fact checking, how is he supposed to handle other world leaders? You think it‚Äôs normal to keep shrinking your world, even cutting out other level headed republicans the right once supported for saying he‚Äôs dangerous? It‚Äôs textbook manipulation. And straight out of the fascism 101 playbook. \n\nThe craziest part is, you want to scream ‚Äúlibs this‚Äù and ‚Äúdemocrats that‚Äù when we aren‚Äôt arguing that the left is infallible.  We are just trying to get you to wake up, and hold your candidates accountable instead of continually moving your moral line to make room for belligerent, harmful, un-American rhetoric.  Despite what some may think, I don‚Äôt personally believe every trump supporter is inherently a bad person. In fact, I think a lot of y‚Äôall are passionate about the country and think you‚Äôre doing the right thing. \n\nI‚Äôve seen how Fox News, the only channel he engages with for the most part (also a red flag) cuts away when he says certain things, the constant twisted narrative and beratement of the left. Vilifying organizations, like fema, for example (who are American first responders- people who drop their lives to help people in dire situations) No lie is too big for them, it‚Äôs not even remotely based in reality at times and it‚Äôs DANGEROUS AGENDA FUELED PROPAGANDA.\n\nFrankly, it‚Äôs sad that you have been cornered into a position where you are so disconnected from reality that you can‚Äôt even see what is happening. The world of maga exists in a tiny microcosm and all we are trying to do is get you to understand that, but it feels like talking to the wall. I don‚Äôt agree with most republicans on policy, but I‚Äôm also voting for one in my district (that has been bullied for supporting democrats and speaking up against her party‚Äôs poor behavior) but we aren‚Äôt even talking policy at this point. Policy discourse is a healthy part of a thriving democracy. However, the current Republican Party has been hijacked by a loud minority of christofascists who have lost the plot, and  their agenda is not freedom or democracy. They are willing to scapegoat anyone if it will make their agenda possible. Even trump is a sock puppet to them. All it takes is a quick look back in history to see examples of this, and it never ends well. \n\nI‚Äôm not saying you need to change your values. I‚Äôm saying I don‚Äôt think the people you are electing actually represent them. Unless you really are a fascist loving, racist, misogynistic twat- which I highly doubt, as most people have good intentions and just want to live in peace. The fact is, Americans have more in common than we don‚Äôt and the entire maga movement is designed to divide us because we have too much power together. I‚Äôm in Asheville and it‚Äôs been devastating in so many ways, but do you know what has been incredible? Everyone coming together to help and support each other and not once did a single person ask who they voted for or what their party affiliation was before helping. THAT is America. So the right can talk the talk, but when it comes down to it, you‚Äôre doing more to harm America than to help it. You should be angry as hell, but you‚Äôre being purposefully aimed with the intent of friendly fire and used as a human shield to protect the interests and power of people that wouldn‚Äôt piss on you if you were on fire.'}, {'Comment Author': 'Surveymonkee', 'Comment Body': ""Wasn't the fictional truckload of militia labelled as Trump supporters here just a few days ago?""}, {'Comment Author': 'Ltrain108', 'Comment Body': 'Your voice of reason was negative 21.

American Rescue Plan and Hurricane Helene Rebuilding,"Just a reminder Trump couldn't or wouldn't pass the infrastructure  funding projects in the American Rescue Plan but Biden did with assistance in the senate from Kamala Harris.

Out of fairness and for the sake of my own morals, I went and re-evaluated my stance. I searched for harder data about where FEMA money was going. And I\'m a little regretful that I\'ll come off as snippy or rude during my summary, but with the amount of malicious actors out there I just don\'t have the patience to make myself softer right now.\n\nSo first, I want to call something out. 1) Your first link literally doesn\'t mention the word migrant or immigrants. 2) your second link says mostly the same stuff as link #1 but adds the words ""spent on migrants""/""to immigrants"" where advantageous, even though those statements are untrue. It\'s just kinda ... lazy writing (?) on the part of the author, and that it\'s obvious it isn\'t a reliable source.\n\nOnward:\n\nThe funds ($640mil) that went to migrants did not come from FEMA\'s budget. That $$$ was from the ""Shelter and Services Program"". If we pretend there wasn\'t intentional attempts to create misinformation, you could say the origin of this ""mix-up"" was from the fact that FEMA -did- distribute those funds. Much like an Uber Eats driver delivers food despite not being part of the restaurant\'s operational budget. (source / info on ""Shelter and Services Program"": [https://www.fema.gov/grants/shelter-services-program](https://www.fema.gov/grants/shelter-services-program) , [https://www.fema.gov/grants/preparedness/shelter-services-program/fy24-awards](https://www.fema.gov/grants/preparedness/shelter-services-program/fy24-awards) )\n\nThe actual origin of the $640mil is the ""Customs Border Protection"" budget. It\'s the thing that makes sure we actually have places to safely house asylum seekers. (And even that budget is under par if you ask me - remember the ""i dont care do u"" scandal? Or the little boy that died of a flu w/ a fever of 102 degrees who got absolutely no medical care for no reason?)\n\n(sources and CBP budget stuff: [https://www.dhs.gov/news/2024/04/12/department-homeland-security-announces-300-million-direct-funding-communities](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2024/04/12/department-homeland-security-announces-300-million-direct-funding-communities) , [https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-04/2024\\_0314\\_us\\_customs\\_and\\_border\\_protection.pdf](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-04/2024_0314_us_customs_and_border_protection.pdf) , I can source the boy and the ""i dont care do u"" scandal if you\'d like.)\n\nI find that using money allocated for border protection on illegal immigrants is appropriate. You might think that number is too big, which is fine. That\'s a whole discussion, but you can take that up with the political party that keeps pushing for higher immigration systems budgets.

Trump is doing more damage than the storm.,"

North Carolina, it is simply beyond comprehension that you can support a man who has gone out of his way to do further harm to your storm ravaged communities; he doesn't give a damn about the pain his constant lying provokes!

It's plain to see his lies are meant to manipulate, to deceive, and if he can convince you through his duplicity that your own government is working against you, then that will fulfill the lust for power that drives him.

He claims he has policies that will cure America's ills, yet he never divulges any real policy, Rather, in his rallies he concentrates on spreading fear, causing division, and trying to manipulate through terror tactics by taking your attention from the real issue.

Listen to his words, do you really believe any of them? And if you see the absurdity now, consider whether he'll ever follow through on his promises.

Look at this -- boldface mine.



""Communities across the Southeast, most notably in North Carolina, have spent the last several weeks trying to recover from Hurricane Helene and its aftermath. It was against this backdrop that **Donald Trump** visited the Tar Heel State two weeks ago and pursued a radical idea: Maybe, the former president said, he could advance his own interests by **brazenly lying about the governmental response** to the deadly storm. **State and local officials, including plenty of Republicans,** asked him to **stop deceiving** the public, but he ignored the appeals ‚Äî even as evidence emerged that **Trump‚Äôs lies were having an adverse impact** on the response to the crisis.

It was, by some measures, a genuine **election-season scandal:** The GOP nominee for the nation‚Äôs highest office saw **devastated communities and human suffering,** which inspired **Trump to repeatedly lie about the heartbreaking circumstances,** hoping it would advance **his quest for power.** Two weeks later, he did it again. NBC News reported that the former president returned to North Carolina, where he ‚Äúagain **made the false claim that FEMA had no money to help victims in the hurricane-stricken area because it was spending funds on migrants.‚Äù**

As he‚Äôs done for weeks, Trump appeared to conflate two completely separate funds to paint a **misleading picture**. FEMA has **dedicated disaster relief money that cannot be used for other purposes,** and it was separately tasked by Congress in 2022 to disseminate money from Customs and Border Protection to help communities that received influxes of migrants. ‚ÄúThey spent a lot of money on bringing illegal migrants. ... They don‚Äôt have any money for the people who live here,‚Äù **Trump said, despite reality.** ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve spent it on illegal migrants.‚Äù

**He was, of course, lying ‚Äî** or more to the point, he was echoing previous lies, which he knows have been discredited, but which he continued to repeat in the hopes that it‚Äôll benefit him personally.

Reminded that these and related conspiratorial lives have led to threats against FEMA workers in the area, Trump expressed relative indifference. ‚ÄúI think you have to let people know how they‚Äôre doing,‚Äù he told reporters. ‚ÄúIf they‚Äôre doing a poor job, are we not supposed to say it?‚Äù I‚Äôm not in a position to say whether Trump actually believes his lies, or whether he knows he‚Äôs peddling nonsense. But either way, the consequences of his dangerous lies are the same.

To be sure, I‚Äôm mindful of the broader circumstances: North Carolina is a highly competitive battleground state, and the latest polling suggests he‚Äôs effectively tied with Vice President Kamala Harris in the state. It‚Äôs hardly surprising that the Republican has concluded that he‚Äôll say whatever he has to say, regardless of accuracy or propriety, to get ahead.

But there is a risk of a backlash. If you‚Äôre an on-the-fence North Carolinian, unsure which candidate to support, and **one candidate comes to your state to lie about the response to a deadly natural disaster,** would you be more or less likely to vote for that candidate?

Trump could‚Äôve simply made an appearance and expressed his support. He instead decided to take a chance by peddling easily discredited nonsense.

He sold us out to enemy dictators  \n\n     Trump *regularly* did things like praise enemy dictators at the expense of US allies and assets, he sold out our intelligence agents overseas, resulting in many of our operatives being discovered, captured, arrested, imprisoned, or killed, and he made backroom deals with enemies of the US.  \n\n    For example, Trump went behind the backs of our US military commanders and strategists and made a deal directly with the Taliban that the US would release over 5,000 prisoners and would pull out of Afghanistan within a certain time. Thousands of US servicemembers and allies were killed during the war in Afghanistan, and Trump just let the bad guys go free. He also completely left the government of Afghanistan *out* of these decisions, so he directly undermined the whole democratic government we spent the past 20 years trying to set up in Afghanistan.  \n\n    On top of that, he also made concessions to dictators like Kim Jung Il, pulled US naval assets away from China and let them expand their sphere of influence, sold state secrets to pretty much everybody, and did things like send *our* covid tests to Putin while telling our people not to worry about the pandemic.  \n\n2. Crippled the economy  \n\n     This one sort of goes without saying. For the past 40 years or so, Republican fiscal policy has wrecked the economy and Democrats have repeatedly had to fix the damage. Most notably, Clinton left a budget surplus which Bush Jr. spent through and left us with billions in deficit, which Obama had to wrestle back down. Trump then took office and left us with a record of nearly $2 Trillion in debt. Trump *also* passed a tax scheme which cut taxes for the wealthiest people while progressively *raising* taxes on people like you and me - the most damaging of which are due to arrive in 2025 and 2027. Been wondering why you've been paying more taxes over the past couple of years? Blame Trump. Our economy is fueled by a strong middle class - our companies make goods, our people buy those goods, and it keeps our money moving around nicely. People get the stuff they need and companies make profit. This keeps people happy. But when our middle and working classes can't afford to buy things, they buy less things, and that slows down the economy. There's less money available and less drive to make new and better products if people can't afford to buy them.\n\n3. A million people ended up dead due to his incompetence.  \n\n    President Obama's administration did the responsible and prudent thing and listened to the experts. We knew, for *years*, that conditions were ripe for a global pandemic, and the Obama administration expanded our existing disaster plans and bolstered our readiness. But Trump threw out those plans and spent the pandemic downplaying the severity, played politics with wearing masks, undermined the CDC and US health officials, and encouraged dangerous lunacy like 'drinking bleach' and 'using UV lights up your butt' to kill covid. \n\nOver 1.2 million Americans died slowly and painfully from covid because Trump is an incompetent fool who doesn't care about any of *us* - all he cares about is himself.""}, {'Comment Author': 'Heart_Throb_', 'Comment Body': 'Oh how feeble some minds are.

contact your local sheriff department, there is a sheriffs helping sheriffs network in NC. Some near me are hosting supply drives.

Also I had to check on someone so I called 211, managed by the United Way, and got my person on a ‚Äúwellness check requested‚Äù list. The 211 service is open 24/7 and United Way runs on donations. Thanks @GoodLuckBart

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello, I hope that you and your loved ones as well. It's really tough seeing all the footage, so many people have lost everything. I've been following the hurricane since it landed, I'm a Floridian (Tampa) who wasn't sure how things were going to play out. But it's been several days since impact and it seems nobody is covering this, even on Twitter/X I don't see anything trending. What's going on? There's nearly no coverage or even recognition that this has been happening. Clearly this is one of the worst disasters to happen in North Carolina's recent history and everyone is asleep at the wheel. 

And a more important question: Is there anything we can do to help? Any where I can donate some clothes, money, non-perishable goods?

I hope things better, much love and God Bless.

I‚Äôm almost out of gas after spending most of a day driving around trying to connect with my daughter and feed the pets of a friend who was trapped by flooding. \n\nWe can‚Äôt leave town even if we have gas as so many roads are closed; most can‚Äôt use GPS to find a route because again, no internet. As of yet, neighbors are helping neighbors and local businesses like breweries and restaurants are giving away food and water‚Ä¶\nWho isn‚Äôt helping? The government at any level‚Äînot local, state or federal has been seen helping people with food, water or hygiene. Though local police fire and EMS are working around the clock to rescue folks, I‚Äôm not speaking against them! \nBut where is our city with port a potties, food and water? Where is FEMA? No one can flush, no one can shower. Some with family out of the disaster zone are trying to get to them, others want to stay and help their community.  Many of us work in the service/tourism industry and now cannot work as well. \n\nWE NEED RELIEF, I cannot overstate how bad conditions are in AVL right now and I fear it will get worse‚Äîoutbreaks of norovirus or Covid due to folks sheltering in close proximity without the ability to do things like wash their hands‚Äîthere is simply not enough clean water. I fear riots will break out if people get desperate enough, have heard rumors of looting already. And another storm is rumored to be coming later this week. That‚Äôs what we have here, rumors, as we are cut off from information from the outside world. Not only is there barely internet, for 48 hrs there was also no phone service and it is still hit or miss. Loved ones were and are desperately trying to find/get information about each other. \n\nRight now it‚Äôs 3:15 am and I‚Äôm lying awake worried that I need to use the toilet at a friend-of-a friend‚Äôs house but know that I can‚Äôt flush. Worried about how I can get gas tomorrow, which I desperately need. Worried about how I‚Äôll pay the bills since my work is shut down.  Praying that more stores and gas stations will open, the crews are out working hard but there are downed trees and power lines everywhere. \n\nTwice a day, there is a local update on the radio but officials keep saying the same bullshit: help is on the way. Someone today asked for Port-a-potties and the response was the idea would be ‚Äúput on the list‚Äù. The list?? Why weren‚Äôt they thinking about this basic need in the community?  The failure of our leadership is going to lead to more deaths and suffering. This community was not in any way prepared for a disaster of this magnitude. \n\nThe one heartwarming takeaway is seeing how the people of WNC truly are there for each other‚Äîsharing what little resources we have, passing information, those few with power opening their homes to guests, hospitality I have been lucky enough to receive.  We are living at the bottom of the hierarchy of needs: my goal every day is just to survive. \nThe overarching need is WATER.

"Given any opportunity, MAGA will take away your vote.","# As reported, the right-wing's MAGA controlled legislature is still considering ways and methods to set aside election results and just award all of North Carolina's electoral votes to Trump. This is the kind of country they are laying the groundwork for. They advocate for a country where, as Trump promised, the Constitution would be invalidated and governance would be controlled by a cadre of insolent and arrogant seditionists, with no input by the voters of the nation.

In their conceit and hubris, they consider themselves to be above you -- all knowing and paternalistic -- and in their authoritarian fever-dream see themselves on high while the underclass, the untouchables, grovel for scraps.

This is the face of fascism, and they make no attempt at hiding it.

Vote now, while you can. Else, the day will come when the niceties disappear, and all decisions will be made by a chosen few.

It happened in Germany, it happened in China, it happened in North Korea, and preparations are now in full swing for it to happen here in North Carolina, and then throughout the nation.

Our only hope is to vote the tyrants out while we can. The must be defeated by an overwhelming margin and then prosecuted for their criminal insurgence so they will never attempt this scheme again.

See this report -- boldface mine.

""Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., chair of the¬†**right-wing House Freedom Caucus**, suggested North Carolina‚Äôs¬†**GOP-controlled legislature should declare former President Donald Trump the winner**¬†of the state‚Äôs 16 electors¬†**before votes are finalized,**¬†giving credence to the far-flung scheme that drew bipartisan rebuke on Capitol Hill. Harris said Thursday during a Republican Party dinner in Talbot County, Maryland, that it ‚Äú**makes a lot of sense‚Äù**¬†to convene the legislature early to¬†**certify electoral votes for Trump before they‚Äôre finalized,**¬†considering that Hurricane Helene may have disenfranchised voters in some counties ravaged by the storm, many of which are heavily Republican.

Harris was responding to a suggestion from pro-Trump activist Ivan Raiklin advocating for North Carolina and other states to certify their election results before they‚Äôre finalized ‚Äúso that those states guarantee that no illegals are voting, no illegal drop boxes, no illegal signature non verifications going on,‚Äù he said during the Thursday meeting, according to a video of the remarks he posted to his X account. Harris suggested¬†**the plan was ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù in North Carolina,**¬†given the devastation from Helene, but questioned whether it would work in other states.

Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., chair of the House Administration committee tasked with overseeing election processes, blasted the plan as a ‚Äú**blood-chilling scheme,‚Äù**¬†in a statement to Politico, adding¬†**‚Äúextreme Republican leaders are openly advocating that North Carolina‚Äôs electoral votes be given to Donald Trump without an election.‚Äù**¬†Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., told reporters Friday he hadn‚Äôt heard about the plans discussed in Talbot County but that ‚Äúit makes no sense whatsoever to prejudge the election outcome. And that is a misinformed view of what is happening on the ground in North Carolina, bless his heart.‚Äù

16. That‚Äôs how many electoral votes belong to North Carolina, one of the seven swing states that will decide the election. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are locked in a dead heat there, with Five Thirty Eight‚Äôs polling average showing Trump leading by 1.3 points.

**Trump and his allies appear to be gearing up to contest the results of the 2024 election if Trump loses.**¬†While Trump has said he hasn‚Äôt seen any signs of fraud so far in the election process and has encouraged his supporters to vote early, he has also said Harris can‚Äôt win unless Democrats cheat.¬†**Republicans have already filed a slew of election-related legal challenges this cycle.**

Oh, wait‚Ä¶.the naming of a post office. Never a committee or sub-committee chair, ever.\n\nThen he lied about only running for 6 terms. Now he‚Äôs running for a seventh. And Harris was the ‚Äúterm limits champion‚Äù until‚Ä¶.he wasn‚Äôt. He even sponsored a term limits bill in the House but he doesn‚Äôt mention that any more.\n\nMs. Croissette writes about Harris‚Äôs parents being ‚Äúrefugees from Eastern Europe.‚Äù No, tell the whole story, which is all there now on the web. For years, Harris touted his father in glowing terms as some find of freedom seeker fleeing ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù (in fact, communism, not democratic socialism which thrives in many countries across the globe, UK, Germany, Canada, Australia, etc). But his father, as a distinguished Yale historian who was a real Hungarian hero found last year, was a member of the Hungarian Nazi Party, the awful Arrow Cross movement which was responsible for the slaughter of thousands of Jews.\n\nNow, Harris fans will say, ‚Äúbut you can‚Äôt blame the sins of the father on the son.‚Äù Oh it is entirely legitimate to force Harris from spreading the lie that Zoltan Harris (just Google ‚ÄúZoltan Harris and Hungary‚Äù), the awful dad, was a democrat (small d). Zoltan Harris fought with the Nazi Army against us and the Allies. Hell, Zoltan Harris, when brought before a Budapest court in 1946, tried to hide his past by joining the Hungarian Communist Party! Fact. And Andy Harris‚Äôs claim that the father was in a ‚ÄúSoviet gulag‚Äù is too clever by half. He was a legitimate prisoner of war and was in a POW camp. Talk about chutzpah. And then Zoltan Harris skipped Hungary for a displaced person camp in Salzburg, Austria, and then managed to slip into the US.\n\nAnd who does Harris support financially? Well, from his war chest he funded the initial runs for Congress of ‚ÄúJewish space lasers/QAnon‚Äù fan, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, and fellow gun nut, Rep. Lauren Boebert. Talk about extremism.\n\nAnd beware of Ms. Croissette‚Äôs artful use of the telling phrase ‚ÄúConstitutional Republic.‚Äù This euphemism is a way of trying to sell the lie that we are not a country where the majority of votes decides on who forms the government in the presidency, or Congress. We are a DEMOCRACY. Some smart alecks like Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah suggest that there is nothing wrong with minority rule. Oh, yes there is.\n\nAnd of course Harris supports The Big Lie, an utter sycophant of Trump who just loves Harris.\n\nI could go on at length.\n\nBut let me finish with this. At the time of writing this response, the appalling Harris has not commented for more than two weeks on the slaughter in Buffalo OR Uvalde. That‚Äôs the pattern.

That's a result of the Party system, which does not exist anywhere in our constitution.\n\nThe process varies party to party as they can make their own rules. Again, no federally controlled process here.\n\nAfter the conception of parties, until 1912, the parties picked their nominee at a caucus with no input from voters.\n\nFrom 1912 to 1968, there was a mix of caucus and elections, entirely so the party could measure popular opinion of the candidates before choosing their nominee. Again, the vote meant fuck all if the party wanted to decide the people chose poorly.\n\nStarting in 1972, after the disaster of the 1968 Democratic Convention, they opted for a more open, electorally binding process. So they wrote their own rules to allow voters to choose their nominee.\n\nin 2024, the nominee who received the most votes **dropped out** after primary voting was largely completed, leaving it up to the Party to determine who to nominate. The party wasn't going to nominate Joe Biden if he declared himself no longer a candidate. There was not enough time, nor support from the States, to hold another election, so they chose a nominee based on major party endorsements.\n\nSo fuck off with this disingenuous, bad faith argument. You just are talking about things you're uneducated in. You're obviously a Trump voter anyway, so why do you care how Democrats choose their nominee? Oh right, because you're sour grapes that a failing candidate got replaced and hurt Trumps chances at winning. Unlike conservatives, we actually can choose not to be stuck with a mistake. You're the ones who are forced to bring these things to term.\n\nWe üëè Vote üëè For üëè President üëè In üëè November üëè General üëè Election\n\nAny other Democrat is free to get on the ballot if they want to be on it and can secure the requirements to do so without being elected in a primary. You can also write in whomever you want. Don't like Kamala? Write in Joe Biden. Or whoever else, idgaf. But that's how it actually works according to our actual laws.\n\nIs giving people input into their party's nominee good? Debateable. On one hand, depriving voters of a choice is a great way to cause bad feelings (see 1968 convention as an example).\n\nOn the other hand, since only the crazies show up to primaries, only the crazies get nominated. See Donald Trump as an example. Then you're stuck voting for them in the General Election.\n\nIn my opinion, the parties should be willing to defer to tell the winner of a nominee to pound sand if they're absolutely dogshit. Mark Robinson is another great example.

It showed up in the local Rutherford County Facebook groups late Friday night/early Saturday am, and was pretty quickly locked down and stomped out.  I won't post his name because he doesn't need any more publicity than he already gets.\n\nLike everything else on FB, it still managed to propagate and multiply rapidly, much like maggots.  The corpses in the trees, floating in ponds and lakes by the dozens, etc, were from a completely different set of posts.  Not sure of the origins, but more than a few of the locals (or those that claim to be locals - there's far more posts than people that actually have power or net access right now - go figure) actually believe it.  There's no real use trying to explain that the most memorable part of witnessing a large group of human corpses is not the sight itself, but the smell.  Even a single body makes a skunk smell like fine perfume.\n\nFor the record, I'm in the southern area of Rutherford County, just outside of Forest City.  We managed to avoid the total devastation that our neighbors to the north received, but we still ended up with literally 10's, if not 100's of thousands of downed trees.  As a result, over 95% of the county has been without power for the last week (we just got ours back at 8pm Thursday night).\n\nFor me, I used Facebook to let friends and family know that we survived, try to get in touch with my co-workers to make sure they're ok (cell service is spotty at best, but rapidly improving) and try to get some information from trusted sources.

Vacation and Hurricane Helene,"Hi all!

I had a trip planned to visit North Carolina (specifically driving from Greenville, SC to Asheville to Blowing Rock) for the 26th-1st. Of course, weather reports come out this week about hurricane Helene and bad weather.

I am from California so I am not quite used to hurricane weather and what to expect. I am wondering how frequently these weather patterns can change, if at all? And whether you (as locals) advise I take my chances or take the loss and try to get refunds on the trip?

Here is the transcript for those who cannot listen to the audio. \n\nSpeaker 1 \nHurricane Helene made landfall in Florida, where that states Panhandle and peninsula meet, but it's in North Carolina, where hundreds of roads remain impassable because of damage from the storm. Deanna Criswell is the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and she joins us now. Welcome to the program. \n\nSpeaker 2 \nGood morning, Aisha. \n\nSpeaker 1 \nDo you know the extent of the damage in places like Western, North Carolina and Eastern Tennessee? \n\nSpeaker 2 \nAisha, this really has been such a significant event that has had damage across 5 star. \n\nSpeaker 2 \nI have reports of major infrastructure damage from Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, as well as Tennessee. Well, Florida and Georgia. The Life Saving piece has stabilized. We are still in an active life saving mode in North Carolina. It'll take some time before we can understand the true extent of all of the damages up there. \n\nSpeaker 1 \nWell, and I wanted to ask you about that because you you see reports online where people are still trying to get rescued in North Carolina. And I understand their state and local and federal interactions here. But what is females role in the? Yeah. \n\nSpeaker 2 \nYeah. So we have right now, I believe it's 9 search and rescue teams in North Carolina. We have more that are coming in today. I talked to our lead on the ground there this morning and and the current information I have is they've done close to 500 rescues with local, state and federal resources. And so we augment. The capability that the state and the local jurisdictions have and we're sending in more resources at their request. To make sure we can get to everybody that's been impacted by those people that are still isolated from the effects of this. \n\nSpeaker 1 \nStorm how long do you think it will take to get these basic necessities that people people are saying, especially in in North Carolina and other places with bad flooding, they don't have food, they are stranded. How can you get those basic necessities? People or get basic infrastructure up so they can make calls and things of that nature. \n\nSpeaker 2 \nYeah, specifically in North Carolina right now, we know that there's been several water systems that have been impacted as well as the communication systems. And so we have moved commodities like food and bottled water into the area. We're moving more in, but we're also have the Army Corps of Engineers that's going to be in the area today. Assessing the impacts to those water systems so we'll understand what it's going to take to bring them back up online and. We're also moving. Starlink satellite into the that western part of North Carolina to help with the common. But we're seeing the same challenges across the other states as well, and we have teams from the Army Corps of Engineer and we have commodities in all of those locations to help as needed. When I was in Florida, I know the state is setting up multiple points of distribution. They're using their own resources, but we have additional resources. If they did need them, and we'll continue. To do that across Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee is needed as well. \n\nSpeaker 1 \nDo you have what you need to do this level of recovery is FEMA staffed and funded in a way that allows it to deal with these more and more powerful storms in this era of climate change? \n\nSpeaker 2 \nWell, Aisha, I think you know you might be aware that we are running low in our disaster relief funds and we went into what we call immediate needs funding in early August. What that did is made sure that we had enough funding in that in that disaster Relief Fund to support an event just like this so we could do the life safety. Work with the continuing resolution. It gives us the ability to spend against the President's budget for fiscal year 25, but without a supplemental, we're going to find ourselves in the same situation with immediate needs funding in January, maybe even earlier, depending on the impacts from this storm. \n\nSpeaker 1 \nCost is something that obviously of life is. First, you know and and there there are a lot of people suffering right now, but but how much do you think this storm will cost your agency, the taxpayers, when all is said and done? \n\nSpeaker 2 \nYeah, I I don't have a good number to give you this early into it, but what I can say is, I mean these are 5 separate major events that each are gonna have significant costs associated to them. Just the amount of infrastructure that I've already seen damaged in Florida. What I'm hearing damaged in the other states. I'm going to Georgia today to check in on them and then I'll be in North Carolina on Monday so I can get a better idea of what those total impacts are. \n\nSpeaker 1 \nThat's FEMA administrator Deanna Criswell. Thank you so much for speaking with us. \n\nSpeaker 2 \nThank you, Aisha.""}, {'Comment Author': 'SW4506', 'Comment Body': 'For those of you in WNC it isn‚Äôt an article, it‚Äôs audio.

"Trump, MAGA, and the GOP plan to disenfranchise every Democrat in the state of North Carolina.","# The Republican party, the GOP of old. has shed every iota of truth, probity, and decency in this openly admitted attempt to do what they have ridiculously charged against the Democrats; change the election results so Trump can't lose no matter the actual vote.

Here is their publicly revealed scheme -- released without shame and in open violation of election laws --of their fascist-like *'Putsch'* to deny the vote of honest citizens who rightfully detest Trump and all he stands for.

This is what a future America will look like if these traitors who support Trump get their way.

This may be the most important thing you read in your life.

Here is their admission -- boldface mine.



Trump's ‚ÄòSecretary of Retribution' Unveils Plot to Nab North Carolina's Electoral Votes

An influential attorney in Donald Trump's campaign to **subvert the outcome of the 2020 presidential election** has outlined a proposa**l for Trump to steal the 2024 electoral college votes** in the state of North Carolina - the results in November be damned. van Raiklin is a former Green Beret and an attorney; he has raised alarms in Congress by positioning himself as a future **""secretary of retribution""** in a new Trump administration, reportedly **compiling an enemies list of more than 300 members of the supposed ""Deep State.**"" Is Raiklin a troll? Sure. But MAGA world is chockablock with such creatures, and this self-styled ""Deep State Marauder"" has juice with people close to Trump. **He's a close associate of Trump-pardoned felon Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn.** And Raiklin' s legal ideas influenced **Trump efforts to subvert the 2020 election.**

Now, Raiklin has a p**lan to overturn any election result in North Carolina** that's unfavorable to the former president. Raiklin **unveiled his plot** at the final stop of the **far-right, Christian nationalist ReAwaken America** Tour in Selma, North Carolina, this past weekend. He was introduced by Flynn, who characterized Raiklin as Special Prosecutor Jack Smith's ""most feared Person of Interest."" Raiklin took ahold of the event's red-white-and-blue mic, and spoke from the same stage where Eric Trump, the president's son, would appear hours later.

Raiklin asserted that the impacts of Hurricane Helene could disproportionately impact GOP voters and affect the results of the 2024 election beyond the margin of a feared Democratic victory. So he called on attendees to exert pressure on the speaker of the North Carolina state House, Tim Moore, and the president of the North Carolina Senate, **one scandal-beleaguered Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson,** to be willing to **subvert any vote** count that favors Kamala Harris, and to transform the state's GOP legislative majorities into a rubber stamp, awarding **North Carolina's 16 Electoral College votes to Trump.** Raiklin's plan hinges, he said, on the legislature leaping into action in early 2025, just before the Electoral College certification in Congress. But only if Trump loses. ""If it's legit, we don't have to worry, right?"" Raiklin told the crowd of the November contest. ""But who thinks it's going to be legit? You think they're just going to give it to you? No, there's going to be a fight!""

Noting that both the North Carolina state House and Senate have strong GOP majorities, Raiklin called on attendees to ""apply the necessary motivation"" **if Trump loses to force them to overturn any Harris victory,** by convincing the bodies' leaders that ""they have the political obligation to remedy an illegitimate election."" Railkin called for his imagined proceedings to be livestreamed on X and Rumble, with a preordained outcome. ""How is the House body going to likely vote, with your motivation?"" he asked: ""For the Republican nominee!"" He suggested the Senate would follow suit. ""Is that a checkmate? Think about that.""

Raiklin said his proposal would be ""the only way‚Ä¶ we can address"" the ""calamity in western North Carolina"" in a ""legal, moral, ethical manner under our Constitution."" He relished that his proposal would cause the ""radical left media"" to ""start to cry."" But he told the crowd that ""everything I say is always legal, moral, ethical, peaceful, and patriotic.""

In reality, Raiklin's proposal **does not appear to have solid legal grounding** \- yet all's fair in love and lawfare for today's GOP. Raiklin began by citing how the U.S. Constitution delegates to the state legislatures the power to run presidential elections - or even select electors on their own. That's true enough. But any changes to established process would have to be enacted before the election.  And according to the Constitution Center, Raiklin's dream of an early 2025 emergency session by the North Carolina legislature would be far too late. The ""safe harbor"" date for all Electoral College disputes to be settled is Dec. 8, and federal law mandates that the results must be delivered to Congress by Dec. 25.

Such niceties didn't seem to bother Raiklin, however. He called on the crowd to **""do what is necessary to take back the state, and then take back the country,**"" and to make sure that North Carolina's votes are ""not stolen by the radical commies‚Ä¶ **and guaranteed, go to the Republican nominee.""**

At 7 p.m. tonight I'm hosting a telephone town hall focused specifically on WNC's recovery from Hurricane Helene. Representatives from FEMA, the SBA and USDA will be live on the call to answer your questions and provide updates. Use 855-710-6225 to join.\r\n\r\n‚Ä¶I feel like someone should ask our Congressman if he will fold to this pressure.  If anyone feels like calling in, it‚Äôs happening now.\n\nI hope we can all agree that there‚Äôs one group that has been helping out during this entire nightmare, and it‚Äôs not the group trying to convince our neighbors to hunt FEMA agents.  Trump & the Republicans see our suffering as an *opportunity* to further disenfranchise us.  Once our votes truly no longer matter, are any of us truly, *truly* foolish enough to think that once we can no longer hold them accountable through elections, that somehow they‚Äôll just solve all of our problems and leave us alone to live happily?\n\nThat‚Äôs a *ludicrously* foolish way of thinking.\n\nNobody in the NCGOP or Republican Party has *ever* contacted me before this election.  I‚Äôve been a registered independent for *over twenty years*.  Don‚Äôt be fooled.\n\nEdit:  So after listening to the intro, it seems like it would be best to hold off on asking the guy if he‚Äôs willing to respect the results of the election to a different event.  It seems like there are a lot of folks in this call that really need to hear - for example, unfortunately - what the basic role of FEMA is.  Right now (*sigh*) the Congressman is talking about how HE discovered just recently what FEMA does & how he‚Äôd like to learn more!\n\nLike‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a good attitude, congressman, but I feel like at least before this call you could‚Äôve figured these things out.\n\nEdit 2:  Oooh, someone‚Äôs already asking him why Congress has failed to come back into session.  Maybe meat‚Äôs back on the menu..?\n\nFinal edit:  There was no need to ask.  Everyone asked basically the same questions, how do I get FEMA help and why isn‚Äôt there more money and services - and the answer was always, FEMA is helping a lot (which was usually stated up front by the person asking the question) and Congress needs to do more.  Edwards seems like he‚Äôs doing his best, or at least putting on a good show where he *appears* that way.  Like, he just said that there was a varying rate for loans, and the FEMA agent jumped in and said ‚Äúnope, it‚Äôs the federal rate, for everyone.‚Äù\n\nIt is nowhere close to enough to earn my vote, but it‚Äôs enough to keep me not-actively-angry.\n\nAs always, just gotta watch what they do.  I *still* may vote for Edwards, he has done a reasonable job during this, I‚Äôve been somewhat impressed.  But what he‚Äôs done is not enough to make up for membership in the party that‚Äôs caused almost all of the non-hurricane related problems in my life & those of my friends & family recently.\n\nIt‚Äôd be pretty swell if the Congressman were able to see that membership in that party helps to validate the very misinformation he‚Äôs holding town halls to push back against.  It was *your* guy who showed up and repeated the false rumors *again* just a couple days ago.  It would‚Äôve been very helpful, I think, to say at least once, something like ‚ÄúPresident Trump said some things when he was here recently that I need to offer a few clarifications on‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nI don‚Äôt think that should be too hard, and if the man comes down on you for that much what was the point of your loyalty to begin with?  \n\nI know that once you‚Äôre tied to a party it‚Äôs difficult to get out.  Maybe the NC Republicans will surprise me, someday.  We‚Äôll see.  I‚Äôd love to have options, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve never aligned with either of the major parties.  Neither of them fully share my values - I think that‚Äôs pretty common - and yet, strictly because of what my values are, I can‚Äôt vote for any Republicans at this time.\n\nI can‚Äôt even trust that my vote will mean *anything* unless it‚Äôs marked for Republicans.  Republicans made it that way.  Why would I ever vote for them of my own free will?  They‚Äôve made it *abundantly* clear that they want a system where my vote can be made invalid so they can ‚Äúwin‚Äù ‚Äúelections,‚Äù which means that if I value democracy and do not wish to live under tyranny, I can *only* vote Democrat and prepare for the worst: When they simply invalidate the election they‚Äôve lost and we have to resort to a different *box* to express ourselves.\n\nI don‚Äôt want that.

"The Trump MAGA lies never stop, and they are inflicting even more pain on North Carolina.","

The question is why is Trump doing everything possible to interfere with the relief efforts of FEMA, and instill fear and distrust to the voters on North Carolina?

This is how despots and tyrants do their filthy deeds. First, they try to convince you your government is against you, and then they lie and say only they can ameliorate the made up issue.

Lies, distortion, deceit, and manipulation will be the hallmarks of any Trump administration.

See this news report.



""As communities across the Southeast, most notably in North Carolina, worked to recover from Hurricane Helene and its aftermath, Donald Trump spent much of last week brazenly lying about the governmental response to the deadly storm. State and local officials, including plenty of Republicans, asked him to stop deceiving the public. He ignored the appeals. Indeed, the misinformation and disinformation campaigns are ongoing. As recently as the weekend, Fox News‚Äô Maria Bartiromo asked the former president whether he believes relief funds were transferred from FEMA to ‚Äúillegal immigrants.‚Äù The Republican insisted that this happened, adding that the evidence to bolster his claims were released by the White House.

None of this happened in reality.

Nevertheless, as my MSNBC colleague Clarissa-Jan Lim has explained, officials have said that Trump‚Äôs election season lies and conspiracy theories have hindered relief efforts, while forcing agencies to waste time and resources combatting lies that too many people are falling for. But as it turns out, there‚Äôs reason to believe there are other consequences, which are every bit as dramatic. The Washington Post reported: Federal emergency response personnel on Saturday had employees operating in hard-hit Rutherford County, N.C., stop working and move to a different area because of concerns over ‚Äúarmed militia‚Äù threatening government workers in the region, according to an email sent to federal agencies helping with response in the state. It‚Äôs difficult to say just how serious the threat might‚Äôve been, but according to the Post‚Äôs report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, it was midday Saturday when officials involved in Hurricane Helene recovery efforts received an urgent message.

It reportedly warned that ‚ÄúFEMA has advised all federal responders Rutherford County, NC, to stand down and evacuate the county immediately. The message stated that National Guard troops ‚Äòhad come across x2 trucks of armed militia saying there were out hunting FEMA.‚Äô‚Äù The email went on to say that incident management team ‚Äúhave been notified and are coordinating the evacuation of all assigned personnel in that county.‚Äù In other words, Trump and too many of his allies have falsely accused FEMA and other federal agencies of neglecting places such as Rutherford County, N.C., while in reality, FEMA and other federal agencies are on the ground, providing relief.

At least, they were, until they reportedly had to be ‚Äúevacuated‚Äù for their own safety ‚Äî not because of unsafe conditions related to the deadly storm, but rather due to concerns that armed extremists might harm them.

Fortunately, the teams returned to work a day later, but that doesn‚Äôt make the circumstances any less breathtaking. Indeed, the Post‚Äôs report documented several related incidents involving threats directed at FEMA as a result of outlandish conspiracy theories. It was against this backdrop that ABC News‚Äô Martha Raddatz asked Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance about Trump‚Äôs Helena-related lies.

‚ÄúPeople are worried that their government doesn‚Äôt care about them,‚Äù the Ohio senator responded.

Perhaps so, but if people in the area of ‚Äúworried,‚Äù it might have something to do with the fact that his running mate and likeminded conspiracy theories lie on a daily basis about the hurricane and the federal response. It‚Äôs twisted reasoning: Trump and his allies lie, and many believe him. Asked about the lies, Vance points to the concerns of those who put their faith in a man who deceived them, as if their fears necessarily have merit, reality be damned.

It‚Äôs the precise logic we saw in the wake of the 2020 election, when Republicans pointed to polls showing a significant number of Americans believed conspiracy theories related to the race‚Äôs outcome. When Democrats pointed to reality, GOP officials effectively replied, ‚ÄúBut look at all of these people who believe otherwise!‚Äù

I do think we have an illegal immigrant problem. I don‚Äôt like that we are spending that much money on it, but I don‚Äôt mind spending some money to make sure that people aren‚Äôt hurt, regardless of citizenship. I think a lot of people who are ‚Äúillegal‚Äù have been in the United States for a long time and for some, particularly those who have been brought here against their will as minors and have no connection to their home country, a path to citizenship is a better answer than deportation.

I dread getting calls from my HISPANIC grandmother about how millions of Mexicans are hopping over the border every day.

I think deporting millions and millions of immigrants in the first six months of his potential presidency would be devastating for America‚Äôs agriculture and hospitality industries since many American citizens will not work those jobs for the pay that immigrants will, and those costs will get passed to the consumer.

Sorry, if this was already posted. I was in Fletcher the past few days helping with hurricane relief. None of us at my job knew the extent of the damage. We lost power and cell service the day of the storm. People were still stranded at gas stations and other locations across Fletcher last night. I finally decided to come back home - I was more curious to see what was happening around the state.

\*The closest cell phone reception that I could find was in the Forest City area.

I'm trying to wrap my head around all of the destruction this storm caused. Unicoi, Erwin (two places I lived) are completely wiped out.

More MAGA lies to dupe the voters of North Carolina.,"Once again MAGA in North Carolina are trying to fool the voters into thinking illegal immigrants are interfering with the distribution of relief supplies. There is no end to the lies they tell, the disinformation and misinformation they will spread, or the heights of exaggeration they will rise to, to insult the intelligence of North Carolina voters in support of Trump and his co-conspirators.

Why do they lie? Why does Trump lie? Because the GOP has no policies that will help America, only phony hearings and their support of Trump's MAGA Manifesto, Project 2025 which will give him almost complete dictatorial power.

It's sad when you consider Project 2025 will hurt the underclass more than anyone, and the simpletons are too ignorant to know it.

See this:



""Fifty-one semi-trucks have had their tires slashed going to help victims in North Carolina,"" reads on-screen text included in the post. ""These are the looters who stole the food & medical supplies from the trucks. Every one of them illegal.‚Äù

Fact check roundup: Hurricane paths, FEMA response spur dangerous misinformation

Our rating: False.

The men pictured have been charged in connection with post-Helene looting in Tennessee, not slashing the tires of aid trucks, according to police. There are no credible reports of trucks delivering aid to victims of Hurricane Helene being looted or having their tires slashed.

Helene carved a path of destruction and claimed more than 200 lives across six southeastern states after making landfall in Florida on Sept. 26. The destruction has been followed by sporadic reports of looting, but the viral post describes events that didn‚Äôt happen. The men pictured were arrested in connection with looting in the flood zone of Washington County, Tennessee, according to media reports. The same mugshots were shared with media outlets by the Washington County Sheriff's Office. The men have since been released on bail, and court records show they all have future court dates.

The men are farm workers in the country legally on work visas and were not arrested for slashing tires, contrary to the post's claims, according to Susan Saylor, public information officer for the county‚Äôs sheriff's office.

There are no credible news reports about the tires of more than 50 aid trucks being slashed. There were reports of tires being punctured on eight trucks at a travel stop in Madison County, Tennessee, as recently as Sept. 26, but that occurred before Helene had reached North Carolina.

USA TODAY previously debunked false claims related to hurricane relief aid, including the claims that hurricane rescue missions were blocked when President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris toured damage in North Carolina, that Biden said there would be no more aid for victims and that police in North Carolina threatened to arrest FEMA workers who blocked aid from getting through.   

USA TODAY reached out to the social media user who shared the claim for comment but did not immediately receive a response.

When a party engages in conspiratorial thinking and messaging, they are not engaging from a position of strength. If a political party feels good about their chances of winning, they will put forth a unifying message and go with a big tent approach.\n\n\nThe Republican Party, at least since Trump, doesn\'t do that. The Republicans right now are horrible at putting out unifying messages, so they can\'t function from a position of strength.\n\n\nWhenever a political party sends out messaging right now, you should always be asking, ""Who does this move to the polls?"". While it is true that this messaging has a function of minimizing voter turnout, this also has a more underlying function of reminding his base who to vote for.\n\n\nIn short, what I\'m saying is that this conspiratorial thinking only appeals to people that were already going to vote GOP. It comes from inside the echo chamber and thus only reaches the people inside the echo chamber. Most of the people in this subreddit aren\'t hardcore GOP, so instead of us receiving the conspiracy media directly from the source, we hear about it because other people are talking about it. That is proof that the conspiracies only have an audience of people that are GOP loyalists.\n\n\nSo, this means that Reps are scared of even the GOP loyalists not voting. The Reps have become the party of Trump and Trump demands loyalty over an actual plan to win elections, which is worrying to him, so they need to remind their base of who they\'re voting for and just try their hardest to get non-GOP people to vote.'}, {'Comment Author': 'Skid-Vicious', 'Comment Body': 'They do this because the same people who think pro wrestling is real will believe it.'}, {'Comment Author': 'Careful-Beach618', 'Comment Body': 'thank you'}, {'Comment Author': 'zooeymadeofglass', 'Comment Body': ""if USA Today is spending their time digging around social media for a comment, they should fold it up and stop pretending to be journalists.

How Glenn Beck could prove his statements, he could really recordings of what he is saying. Or show the article from a verifiable source.

North Carolina governor blasts flat out lie' from Trump on disaster aid.,"Just how stupid do Trump and his MAGA allies think North Carolinians are?

Trump thinks he can tell any lie, spread any disinformation, do any harm to its citizens, and can get away with it. He thinks because North Carolinians were once heavily invested in Republican policies and philosophy, they haven't noticed the Party has changed. No longer the party of the respectable legislators like Reagan and Bob Dole, the GOP has slid into the morass of party politics, hate, lies and deceit, and Trump is convinced he can *manipulate the voters* by instilling fear where there is nothing to fear, and with absurd tales of corruption and incompetence, despite all the evidence to the contrary.

His aim is not to unite, his aim is to win by dividing us, encouraging us to hate on another, and with that division turn a democracy into a prototypical fascist state; one look at his MAGA Manifesto, Project 2925, will tell you all you need to know about his intentions.

Here is but one section of Project 2025: ...raise the FEMA threshold for public assistance and end Small Business Administration (SBA) direct lending such as disaster loans, which help businesses and homeowners recover from declared disasters. This would leave communities with fewer resources to rebuild after disasters like catastrophic hurricanes and tornadoes. \[153\] \[750\] \[754\]

His behavior has become so outrageous, Republicans like senator Thom Tillis, who once held their noses are now speaking out in defense of America.

See this -- Boldface mine.

""North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) hit **former President Trump** for claiming that the **governor‚Äôs office was blocking people and money from going into the state as it recovers in the wake of Hurricane Milton.**

**‚ÄúThis is a flat out lie,‚Äù** Cooper wrote in a post Frida**y on social platform X. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working with all partners around the clock to get help to people. Trump‚Äôs lies and conspiracy theories have hurt** the morale of first responders and people who lost everything\*\*, helped scam artists and put government and rescue workers in danger.‚Äù\*\*

Cooper‚Äôs comments were in response to a post from Trump on Truth Social on Friday.

‚ÄúIt has just come out that Democrats in Washington and the Democrat Governor‚Äôs Office of North Carolina (Roy Cooper) were blocking people and money from coming into North Carolina to help people in desperate need,‚Äù Trump wrote. ‚ÄúBiden knew about it, and so did Kamala! It‚Äôs all over the place ‚Äî A HORRIBLE SITUATION. I will make it up to everyone when we take Office on January 20th. HOLD ON, I‚ÄôM COMING!‚Äù he added in the post.

**Trump and his allies, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and tech billionaire Elon Musk, have repeatedly attempted to spread misinformation in the wake of hurricanes Helene and Milton.**

The Republican presidential nominee has **received backlash for suggesting that federal officials are ‚Äúgoing out of their way to not help people in Republican areas‚Äù** and saying **Vice President Harris** ‚Äúspent all her FEMA \[Federal Emergency Management Agency\] money, billions of dollars, on housing for illegal migrants.‚Äù

President Biden called **Trump‚Äôs claims about Hurricane Milton ‚Äúun-American‚Äù** and urged the former president to **stop spreading disinformation** about the government‚Äôs response. ‚ÄúOver the last few weeks there‚Äôs been **reckless and irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation and outright lies** about what‚Äôs going on,‚Äù Biden said in remarks from the White House earlier this week. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs harmful to those who most need the help. **Quite frankly these lies are un-American,‚Äù** Biden added. ‚ÄúAnd there‚Äôs simply no place for them, not now, not ever.‚Äù

FEMA launched a ‚Äúrumor response‚Äù site in an effort to combat claims related to how much funding the agency provides to disaster survivors, blocking aid and preventing evacuations, and restricting airspace, among several other allegations.

The Hill has contacted the Trump campaign for comment.

Helene in Hot Springs?,"My husband and I are supposed to be getting on a plane from Boston to Asheville tomorrow morning to attend our best friend‚Äôs wedding in Hot Springs on Saturday.

FEMA Responds: No funding was diverted to support international efforts or border related issues.,"From FEMA's [disinformation tool](https://www.fema.gov/disaster/current/hurricane-helene/rumor-response):

**Rumor:** 

Funding for FEMA disaster response was diverted to support international efforts or border related issues.

**Fact**:

This is false. No money is being diverted from disaster response needs.

Are there any towns not effected by Helene?,"Greetings from Florida, hope everyone is safe from Helene.

  
My family was supposed to go to Asheville in a couple weeks for vacation, but I heard that it may not be the best place to visit for a little bit. Could anyone give me a couple recommendations on cool towns that weren't effected by the hurricane? Looking for a place that has breweries, and decent hiking. Trying to stay about 2 hours away from Charlotte. Thank you!

Edit: going to Raleigh! Thanks to your responses.

P.S. got a couple responses to go to Lumberton. Judging by the name, they probably got woods, so I‚Äôd be down for it actually.

Major North Carolina newspaper knocks Trump over Helene response ‚Äòfalsehoods‚Äô,"We all know Trump is a pathological liar; he can't help himself. In his efforts to disparage President and the Democrats what he has actually done is frighten the citizens of North Carolina into believing Federal help is not already bringing assistance to beleaguered areas of the state. Regardless of the fact the Governor has gone out of his way to dispute the lies, Trump continues to spread misinformation and disinformation saying Kamala has spent FEMA money on illegal immigrants, an act in itself illegal.

If this is the way Republican presidential candidate treats the state now, imagine the harm he'll do in the future if he gets the opportunity.

When he was in office, he wanted to cut off aid to California, money necessary to fight forest fires. In his vindictiveness he doesn't care who he hurts, as long as he can do some harm to those he considers political enemies.

His actions are clearly reminiscent of William Vanderbilt, a Republican from a former age, who said, 'The public be damned!'

See this -- Italics mine



A leading newspaper in North Carolina is **blasting former President Trump over** what it calls **his ‚Äúfalsehoods‚Äù about the government response to Hurricane Helene,** which devastated a large swath of the state last week.

**‚ÄúThis is not a situation to capitalize on for political gain.** But former President Donald **Trump has politicized the situation** at every turn, **spreading falsehoods and conspiracies** that fracture the community instead of bringing it together,‚Äù the editorial board of The **Charlotte Observer wrote this week. ‚Äú**By every indication, state and federal agencies have been working to help people in need. They‚Äôve been airlifting food and other supplies to affected areas.‚Äù

The Observer noted Trump‚Äôs statements in recent weeks claiming Democratic state and federal officials are ‚Äúgoing out of their way to not help people in Republican areas,‚Äù and saying Vice President Harris ‚Äúspent all her FEMA money, billions of dollars, on housing for illegal migrants.‚Äù  **‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no evidence to support any of those ridiculous claims,**‚Äù the newspaper shot back.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs be clear: **Western North Carolina is not a political football.** This is not a campaign opportunity,‚Äù the outlet continued. **‚ÄúThe most unhelpful thing any politician ‚Äî or anyone else ‚Äî can do right now is spread misinformation** and tell people that their government isn‚Äôt doing anything to help them.‚Äù

Public polling shows North Carolina as one of several key battleground states less than a month out from the election, with Harris and Trump virtually tied there.

**‚ÄúSowing the seeds of political division** is always an unnecessary and tiresome endeavor,‚Äù the Observer continued. ‚ÄúBut doing so in times of great need, when unity is paramount, **is particularly shameful.‚Äù**

|My fellow North Carolinians,¬† ¬† The destruction caused by Helene is incomprehensible and has left many communities in Western North Carolina absolutely devastated. The last thing that the victims of Helene need right now is political posturing, finger-pointing, or conspiracy theories that only hurt the response effort. The immediate focus needs to be supporting search and rescue operations and ensuring the safety of everyone in harm‚Äôs way. ¬† Make no mistake that the full recovery process will be long and difficult. So many families have lost their homes and all their belongings, while entire communities have been destroyed by flooding. I will do everything in my power to help make them whole again, and I have already started working in the U.S. Senate to pursue long-term federal assistance for families and communities left devastated from the flooding.  This long-term federal assistance will be the key to Western North Carolina‚Äôs recovery over the coming months and years to rebuild homes, infrastructure, farms, roads, and highways that were damaged or destroyed. I will also keep pushing to change federal law to get rid of unnecessary red-tape and¬†bureaucracy that needlessly delays the start of the long-term rebuilding process.¬†  When it comes to immediate needs for federal assistance, please know there are a number of programs available for homeowners, small business owners, and farmers who have suffered property damage or loss. If you have a question about the process or are not getting the help you need from the federal government, please don‚Äôt hesitate to contact my office and we will assist you.

Or the pressures of a place like Boone where there is constant complaining about lack of affordable housing because the university is how many times larger than it was 20 years ago but the developers constantly fight against planning and ‚Äúonerous‚Äù building codes. Or the out of state folks looking for vacation properties- I honestly don‚Äôt care how much more cheaply you can build this in FL or AL (or insert state here), you are building at 4,000 ft on the side of a mountain, you really do need to care about both high winds and runoff. \n\nAs horrible as this all has been - the historical and geological record shows that it‚Äôs happened before and there is no reason to believe it won‚Äôt happen again. \n\nThe people of the WNC mountains are resilient and have a strong sense of community but there are a lot of pressures on those communities- and the more that can be done to encourage rebuilding in a way that enhances and encourages resilience the better off we will be for future events.'}]"

How long will it take to rebuild?,"The damage from Helene is absolutely horrifying. I can't believe that a hurricane that touched down in Florida did so much damage so far away from the original landfall. It honestly boggles my mind. I guess it's because of how most places in North Carolina are built at the bottom of mountains, but still.

My question is, how long will it take to rebuild? Because I've seen some highways that are going to be closed until 2028, at least according to Google Maps. That is just absolutely insane. But when you think about how hard building these roads originally was, it makes sense.

I do have a more targeted question though. What about the Great Smokey Mountains? I know, I know. I'm sorry that this is one of those annoying ""what will happen to my trip"" posts. But I genuinely do need to know. I'm going to be at a conference in Tennessee next September, and was planning to visit the mountains, but it's genuinely looking like it'll still be quite bad by then.

Do you think the park will be built back enough by then?

State Employees‚Äô Credit Union update: Out of the loop? Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs been going on. Board election happening now (voting ends Oct. 1) ,"Long post (apologies), **TL;DR** & links to more info at end.

Some of you may remember some discussion last year about what was going on at SECU‚Äîlots of conversation about controversial decisions and policy changes. If you haven‚Äôt been paying attention, here‚Äôs some context:

In 2021, SECU hired Jim Hayes. He was the first CEO in SECU history not to be hired from within the ranks of veteran SECU employees. Why does that matter? Well, SECU has been described as a bit of a ‚Äúunicorn‚Äù among financial institutions. It‚Äôs the second largest credit union in the country (behind only Navy Federal) at $50 billion, 2.8 million members, 275 local branches, and the largest ATM network in NC. 1 in 4 North Carolinians are members of SECU. This means it can do (and historically has done) more for its members than most credit unions can dream of.

SECU isn‚Äôt a bank. It‚Äôs a member-owned, not-for-profit, financial cooperative. The last 3 years have seen SECU‚Äôs Board make dramatic policy changes that move us closer to resembling for-profit banks than ever before. These include: implementing a discriminatory risk-based lending system, paying out uncompetitive savings rates, preventing members from speaking at our Annual Meeting for the first time in our history, sustaining $250 million in loan losses this year alone, and much more‚Ä¶. (For more on this, see end of post.)

In an extraordinarily rare event for credit unions and not-for-profit organizations, members launched a campaign nominating their own candidates to challenge the board-nominated incumbents in 2023. All 3 member-nominated candidates were elected, but that was only 3 seats on an 11-member board. Right now, this year‚Äôs board election is wrapping up on October 1st. This time 4 member-nominated candidates are running against the incumbents.¬† The board nominated only its own candidates again, which required the member-nominated candidates to gain signatures to get on the ballot‚Äîwhich they did, to the tune of more than 8,000 members across NC.

This member movement has coalesced into a grassroots group called ‚ÄúSECU For All‚Äù with the goal of advocating for member rights, restoring SECU‚Äôs principles, and defending the mission of SECU: ‚Äúpeople helping people.‚Äù The member-nominated candidates need our votes to hold this Board of Directors accountable and get SECU back on track. They are 4 leaders with tremendous experience that includes 75+ combined years at SECU.

**If you‚Äôre a member age 16+, please vote for Jean Blaine, Susie Ford, Julian Hawes, and Kirby Parrish. Here‚Äôs the link for instructions on how to vote**: [secuforall.com/vote](http://secuforall.com/vote)

October 1st is the final day to vote online! You can also vote via the ballot you received by mail (must be postmarked by Oct. 1st) or vote in person at the Annual Meeting if you‚Äôre registered to attend.

Disclosure: This isn‚Äôt my primary Reddit account, but yes I‚Äôve been a user for years and am a lifelong resident of NC. I am an unpaid volunteer with SECU For All and a longtime member of SECU.

**TL;DR**: SECU has suffered serious changes since 2021; there‚Äôs a critically-important contested Board election ending soon (Oct. 1st is the last day to vote). The current Board of Directors has implemented discriminatory risk-based lending system, paid out uncompetitive savings rates, prevented members from speaking at our Annual Meeting for the first time in our history, sustained $250 million in loan losses this year alone, and much more. There‚Äôs a grassroots member movement called ‚ÄúSECU For All‚Äù challenging the incumbent board with 4 member-nominated candidates‚Äîvote for Blaine, Ford, Hawes, & Parrish.

[SERIOUS] I live in PA and I want to help. ,"I‚Äôve been paying attention to what‚Äôs been going on down in North Carolina and I want to do what I can to help. I can imagine it is difficult to get supplies to some places.  I am currently in a position where if it is needed I could transport supplies down there. I have relationships with numerous nonprofit organizations in my area and feel with a few proper connections and some social media posts we could garner enough support to fill a a decent size Uhaul truck.

My question is: if I could coordinate this within a short amount of time, is it is there someone who would receive this, and is there a point person I could talk to that could help be coordinate where it should be received? I would also need to know exactly what supplies are needed.

Watching the news and reading stories about what‚Äôs going on I feel heartbroken, and I want to help. If this would be beneficial, please let me know and let me know who to talk to on the NC end to help coordinate this. Thank you.

Please note - I am NOT asking for donations or supplies. All I‚Äôm asking for is a little guidance and a contact. Thanks.

UPDATE: I emailed FEMA following others‚Äô suggestions - it 100% makes sense to go though *one* point of contact, and it 100% makes sense it should be FEMA - and will be awaiting their response. Thank you u/KulaanDoDinok et al.

Thank you again for others' advice, especially starting with FEMA and working through the responsible agencies. I understand that while driving a truckload of cleaning supplies or bottled water might be beneficial, it also might not, and may actually be inconvenient or even unsafe. Working directly with those organizations is critical to ensure our efforts are safe and effective and actually providing a substantive benefit.

I have a fundraiser going on for another org I'm deeply tied to, but I might have another one I can do for the raising cash component. I'm going to start looking through volunteer opportunities through [https://www.ncvoad.org/volunteer/](https://www.ncvoad.org/volunteer/) as well, and give an honest look at what I might be able to take on. My heart goes out to you folks and I want to do what I can.

Tips for FEMA Assistance ,"FEMA has declared Individual Assistance (IA) for Hurricane #Helene for 25 western NC counties and Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. What does this mean for you? It means that you can apply for disaster assistance from FEMA to help offset your disaster-related expenses.

You can apply online at https://www.disasterassistance.gov/ or by telephone at (800) 621-3362. Otherwise, you can download the FEMA weather app from Google PlayStore or the Apple Store and you can apply for assistance on the app and upload receipts. Whichever method you choose, the form has a few questions that are tricky. To avoid delay, please follow the following tips:

1. One of the questions that FEMA will ask when you register is ‚ÄúDo You Have Emergency Needs‚Äù? This means during your evacuation or since staying at home during the disaster, do you need help with Gas, Medication, Food (meals, water, had no power and everything spoils), Shelter (you are staying with friends, family or in a hotel); Clothing; or Durable Medical Equipment (oxygen, walkers, cane, glasses, all major equipment, etc). If this is true, say ‚ÄúYES‚Äù to this question. That will result in your receiving Displacement / Critical Needs Assistance, which is $750.

2. When asked if your home is/was accessible, answer ""NO"" if there was debris, tree branches, continued flooding, loss of power, damage or destruction that prevented you from staying there after Helene. This question is asking whether you can stay at your home or apartment and will trigger the ability for you to receive assistance to pay for hotels or provide funding to use while you stay with family or friends.

3. When asked if utilities are out, say ""YES"" even if your utilities were out for a few days. This triggers assistance $ to stay somewhere other than your home or to buy fuel to power a generator.

4. When asked ‚ÄúAre you willing to relocate‚Äù say ""YES"" if you cannot live in your home due to damage, loss of power, etc. This question means you are willing to stay in a hotel or apartment temporarily, and triggers that funding for you. It is not asking if you are willing to move away from your home permanently.

5. If you bought or buy a generator, FEMA will reimburse you up to $629, but you must submit the receipt. If you bought a chainsaw, FEMA will reimburse you up to $219. Again, you need to provide the receipt. Save your receipts.

Move fall 2025 wedding?,"First off I would like to say I am not trying to come off distasteful or selfish by any means, we are extremely devastated for all of WNC and want to make the right decision and what‚Äôs best for everyone, not just us. We booked our venue two weeks before the hurricane hit and we have been taking in all of the information we can to make the right decision but it‚Äôs getting a little shifty across socials and what‚Äôs being reported and we need to make a decision this week since we‚Äôre almost a year out. 

I absolutely want to keep our wedding plans as is and support these small businesses we were planning to use but I have a few concerns. Our venue is in Biltmore village, and after recently hearing from our venue, they miraculously did not get major damage from Helene and shared that once they have power and water restored they will reopen. While I have seen the devastation for the biltmore village and surrounding areas I know that is not the case for all and have been told it will obviously look a lot different by this time next year.  

Our main concerns: we are both from up north and have 80% of our guest list traveling in for this so hotels/airbnbs, road travel and things to do are what we‚Äôre most worried about. Guests would be driving from Raleigh and Charlotte or flying directly to the Asheville airport if they‚Äôre up north. 

Any and all local perspectives are wanted, we are well aware this is not what is most important but we visit every year for our anniversary and want to share the beauty of the mountains with all of our loved ones but ultimately want to make the best decision for everyone coming to visit and celebrate us.

Asheville had already gotten record rain prior to Helen's arrival,"I know the NC reddit just loves humping each other over climate change but for those who can get past their ADHD and remember just 5 days ago, we got huge amounts of rain from storms that weren't remotely related to Helene. This was not a climate change induced SUPER hurricane. This was a storm then another storm and them another storm that all came during an already record rainfall month for the Asheville area. 

This might be hard for many of you who have only been alive for 15 years but floods are not new for NC or anywhere. The world has had floods since it started raining. Get over yourselves.

>The flood of 1916 broke every record in the book and was one of the largest floods on record to hit North Carolina. The destruction due to the excess rainfall defined flooding for an entire generation, while streams and rivers, already full from previous rains, surged across low ground with startling speed in mid-July of 1916.

List of state parks closed until the end of October:,"From the North Carolina State Parks and Recreation page on FB:

Our staff are assisting with the statewide emergency and rescue efforts in western North Carolina. The division is currently prioritizing resources, both staff and equipment, towards immediate and lifesaving needs.

All state parks west of I-77 are closed through at least Oct. 31, 2024:
- Chimney Rock State Park
- Crowders Mountain State Park
- Elk Knob State Park
- Gorges State Park
- Grandfather Mountain State Park
- Lake James State Park
- Lake Norman State Park
- Mount Jefferson State Natural Area.

Reservations for campsites, cabins, and other facilities have been cancelled and issued a full refund.

Also: most events and programs scheduled for October have been cancelled at all state parks across NC. The following will occur as scheduled:
- Goose Creek After Dark, 10/5 
- Dismal Day at Dismal Swamp, 10/12
- Fear at the Fort (Fort Macon), 10/18-19 and 10/25-26
- Schools in Parks training at Carolina Beach, 10/26

We appreciate your patience and understanding as we put helping our neighbors and communities first. Our hearts go out to those who are grieving and have lost so much because of the storm.",https://i.redd.it/z0yvheew5tsd1.jpeg,1728077590.0,EllyDarling,NorthCarolina,[]
Possible to get a mega-thread or other guide for how to (and how not to) assist?,"I know people flocking to the area to help those affected by the storm can cause more harm than good as they block roads, take resources, get themselves in trouble as well, etc.. I also know unscrupulous people can take advantage of disaster fund-raising.

Is there a resource, or can we make one, with info about how we can help our NC neighbors in the coming weeks/months?  That is, a post keeping track of legitimate or vetted fundraising or item drives, local assistance requests that individuals may be able to help with, and eventually when things open up, information about getting together to go volunteer to help with clean-up in affected areas?

Edit: Gonna start a list.

"Helene, Asheville, Landlord/Property management issue with trees and mobile home damage!?","Hello folks,

Wondering if anyone knows or has dealt with this lately. I'm in what used to be a quaint mobile home park. I own my mobile. But, the people who bought the park have completely neglected it for the past 3 years. They've raised property rent triple. They don't accommodate tenants and neglect the property. For this hurricane, there were hundreds of trees 5-10 feet from everyone's mobile, it was basically a death trap in the storm. They haven't sent anyone out here to check on anything for communicate.

The only thing they've done is make the same 3, poor dudes who they paid for independent contracting to cut down trees and are just throwing them down in a wooded area below the park lol. 3 dudes for an entire 100 house park with disaster all over.

There has to be some laws or rules for property management in situations like these to maintain tree lines safely from the buildings right? These people are taking advantage of so many families and elderly folks here. I had a 40 foot, big tree that was directly next to my front door fell down like nothing. Roots still vertical 9 feet in my yard.

I've called and emailed multiple times with 0 response. I didn't get a 10 day eviction warning on the 6th. At this point, I would rather pay my rent into escrow and sue the shit out of these guys. If the wind had seriously just blown in any other given direction we could have had some extreme tragedy here. Luckily the trees just smashed houses and cars for the most part.

I'm not sure if my next step is to call the county inspector out here or what. If anyone is knowledgeable on property management rules, laws and guidelines please feel free to share.
