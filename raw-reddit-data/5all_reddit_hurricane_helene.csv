Hurricane Helene flooded us - lower cabinets and flooring are removed.    Thoughts on what to go back with?,"I’m a bit overwhelmed so wanted to ask for opinions.    Our home had flood damage from Hurricane Helene.    All of the flooring in the home has been removed, as has the lowers.

The second picture is what we are wanting to do for flooring.    We are thinking of going back with white cabinets.    Our dark granite countertops were saved.  

1) Do you think dark granite would look ok with that grey flooring in the second pic and white cabinets?   

2) Would it look bad if we just replaced the lowers with white and then painted the tops?    They are oak.     What might be options there?    Or should we just replace the uppers too?    (That would be out of pocket, insurance won’t cover that).

3) any other recommendations you might have? 

Like I said, we are a bit overwhelmed.     These photos are pre-gutting.      Any direction, advice is appreciated.    If there’s any easy to use website where we could put the photo in and visualize cabinets and flooring, that would help too!  

Thanks in advance for reading.  ",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gdlu9m,1730064701.0,Ashattackyo,kitchenremodel,[]
Hurricane Flooding destroyed our washer and dryer - NO idea where to start with deciding on a new washer/dryer.  Help?,"Our home flooded during hurricane Helene.    We are displaced while our home is being repaired/rebuild.    I'm so overwhelmed with all of the decisions we have to make, and I was wondering if any one can guide me in the right direction for replacing our washer and dryer.    

We had an older top load washer and regular dryer.     We just want something that wont tear our clothes and works well.    It does not have to be fancy.   Preferably something trusted/has been in production for a long time V. the newer ""fancier"" models.  It's just two adults and two dogs in the home.     

What are decent washer/dryer brands and models to replace ours with, that also won't be crazy expensive?    

I usually do a lot of research on things... but with my limited time, energy and resources I thought maybe Reddit could help crowd source some ideas for me.

"18 YO daughter totaled someone else’s car, driving with permission.","My 18 YO daughter was evacuating Hurricane Helene (in FL) with one of her roommates, and driving her roommate's car with her permission. My daughter was over the speed limit and hydroplaned, causing an accident, totaling her roommates car in the process. Fortunately there have been no injuries. 

Roommate submitted a claim to her own insurance and got market value for the car, which is not enough to replace the vehicle. She's pretty upset and asked my daughter to contribute to the cost of replacing her car. We've provided our insurance so she could try to make a claim for additional, but of course our insurance denied the claim. 

Now the roommate is planning to sue my daughter and meeting with a lawyer tomorrow to discuss this. 

My daughter is 18, so a legal adult, but we do the usual stuff that families do for their kids if they can. She's on our insurance, we're helping her pay for college, etc. Am I correct in assuming that if my daughter is sued, we have no liability?

Assuming the roommate proceeds, what's the most likely outcome from all this? Does my daughter need to hire a lawyer?

I may be operating under the faulty assumption that since the roommate allowed her to drive, and was in the vehicle at the time of the accident, that my daughter has no further obligation to pay after the insurance claim was settled. 

My daughter is a broke college kid and doesn't have enough money to buy a car or help someone else buy a car. I'm not inclined to rescue anyone from the consequences of their actions, but I'm also not willing to hang my kid out to dry in a situation outside her experience.

Since your daughter is 18, she’s legally an adult, so no, you as parents aren’t liable. In terms of a lawsuit, she can technically represent herself in small claims if it comes to that, though a quick consultation with a lawyer might give her peace of mind. They could clarify that her “financial responsibility” likely ended with the insurance payout.\n\nThe roommate might just be frustrated and looking for someone to blame, which is understandable after a loss like that. But here’s the bottom line: unless there’s evidence of gross negligence beyond what’s already covered in the insurance payout, this likely won’t go far.

Advice needed,"We live in SC and have a confirmed termite infestation, despite having a termite bond in place with the Sentricon system.  A few background items to note:
1. Before we bought the home in Oct. 2021, the wood infestation report found one tube on the exterior of the home which was treated.
2. We have a recurring small roof leak around our chimney - this was supposedly fixed prior to purchasing the home in Oct. 2021, and we had a different roofer fix it again in Jan. 2023.
3. Prior to the second roof repair, I found what I was pretty sure was evidence of termites in the attic crawl space.  I called our pest control company who inspected and said there were some old tubes in the attic but nothing active.  He sprayed some Termidor foam in the area to make me feel better.  I showed him another area on a baseboard nearby that he said was old water damage and definitely NOT termites.  I showed him a different area below the fireplace where I had seen some frass below a hole.  He again said not termites, but supposedly shot some foam in the area to make me feel better.

Fast forward to hurricane Helene, and I noticed the baseboard area with old water damage looked wet again.  I also noted new termite tubes in the attic crawl space (other side of chimney from baseboard) and even saw termites after poking around in the damp area.  Called in the termite guys, and this guy acknowledged there was termite activity going on, and says he found one tube in the crawl space on the chimney (which he supposedly inspected back in July).  They don’t do exploratory work, so I had to get another contractor to tear out the baseboard (I insisted that they wait to do the treatment until we opened the area up to see what was going on in there).  The baseboard was crawling with tons of termites. Next week the roof is being repaired again (hopefully) and the technician is coming to treatment the termites.  

While I want to trust them as the professionals, I am leery after our previous experience.  This technician is more experienced than the last guy, but is also the one who does our inspections, so I felt like he was downplaying how bad the situation is to cover the fact that it happened on his watch.  How do I know if the infestation has been successfully treated?  Part of the area where they were found is hard to access as it is in the plywood around the chimney and it’s impossible to see how far down they go towards the first floor.  The contractor who tore the drywall out doesn’t think they got into the floor, but they most likely came up from the ground, so are they all in the walls?  Are there any questions I should be asking or things I should make sure they do?  Thanks for any advice!

What’s frustrating is that I am someone not trained in identifying termite activity and I showed them multiple areas and told them my concerns, and rather than telling me the only way to know is rip open the area, the guy said it def. wasn’t termites.  I feel like if I could tell something was going on, the trained professionals should have at least had the same suspicions and urged me to explore deeper rather than write off my concerns.  Apparently all of the other techs are larger guys, but I don’t want that smaller guy again, so not sure how they are going to access the area to treat.

"Help, what did I do wrong with my fall TTTF overseeding?","Help, what did I do wrong with my fall overseed?

Feeling extremely frustrated at the money and time I spent on prepping and overseeding my backyard with Lesco blue tag TTTF and now seeing this as the result 3 weeks after watering everyday (minimum 20 min). Soil test indicates perfectly healthy soil. 

Last year we had a guy come out to rip all ivy out of backyard and he used a bobcat so the ground was very compacted from that and also dry from an insanely hot summer. Manually pulled out all the crab grass before aerating to make sure there’d be good seed to ground contact. Full sunlight most of the day. Did not top dress as I’ve had success without it in the past (also to save money and my back). Also, had to wait a week or so after aerating before seeding due to Hurricane Helene rain coming through, could that have recompacted the soil?

Had to wait a couple weeks before seeding due to Hurricane Helene weather coming through, could that have recompacted the soil?

3 weeks later I have a bunch of weeds and barely anything coming up. What did I do wrong? I assume I’m screwed for this season or am I being impatient?

Thank for your help in advance!

To build a new woodworking shop ourselves or buy new? ,"Hurricane Helene demolished our home woodworking shop. The building was old and here when we bought the house, but it was big 16x24 and we built it out to work well for our needs. Insurance gave us about 10k, which isn’t quite enough but we can pitch in a little extra. Now we need to decide whether to build one ourselves or buy a new building. We built a 10x12 building at our previous home. We are pretty handy, but we now have a 1 year old. Is it worth the planning, preparation, and time to build a new one ourselves or should we just buy? Having a hard time coming up with exact numbers to determine if we will really be saving money by building ourselves. I definitely realize by building ourselves we can make it exactly what we want. Either way we only have around 10K-ish to work with. Curious for some feedback.

"Emotionally sensitive cat, thought we had fixed his issues, suddenly started peeing on couch, clean bill of health otherwise ","Recently got back from the vet for my 3 year old grey boy munchkin cat, has a clean bill of health, current shot records, otherwise perfectly healthy says my vet. 

A little background on my cat, he’s a grey munchkin who was a perfectly loving chill cat who was great until I took him to get fixed at our vet. When he came back he was a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT cat. Almost as if he was suffering from PTSD, even slight noises bothered him, he refused to come out for petting and to be social, stayed in quiet dark areas of the house, etc. it took him 6-12 months to finally start being an amazing cat again. We moved into a new house and after a month he turned into the cat he was when we first adopted him. Social, loving, chill, etc. we were both overjoyed…. Until recently. 

We lost power for 10 days due to hurricane Helene but fortunately I had plenty of food, water, and treats to keep him fed during that time so besides the power being out it wasn’t unlivable. 

After the power came back on it’s like he blames me for the issues we faced. He is peeing in the same spot on my couch, and others when I attempted to prevent him from accessing that spot. He’s been being distant, both physically and emotionally by staying in a certain place in the house. I’ve loved on him, talked to him, gave him treats, apologized for the hurricane, etc. but he’s been peeing outside of the litter box ever since the hurricane. 

What do I do? I can’t keep him if he’s treating my new home like a toilet. I’ve worked too hard to let him destroy it. Ive made sure the litter box is always clean and fresh, that he feels loved, that it’s not a diet related issue, he’s completely healthy, etc. 

TLDR; emotional cat is healthy according to vet but has been peeing as a form of protest I assume after dealing with the power bring out for Helene. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1gdf9cc/emotionally_sensitive_cat_thought_we_had_fixed/,1730047483.0,ShowMeYourMoods,CatAdvice,[]

Considering going to their house for medical help,"Im stuck between a rock and a hard place right now.   


Im 32 but I have a *lot* of chronic health problems. Nobody knows more about them than my fiance. Ive also had many experiences of doctors blowing me off, sending me home, telling me scans were normal when they werent, etc. (I had a doctor tell me my scans were normal, and I believed him, until I finally got them in front of another doctor in another state who said two veins in my brain had collapsed and ended up placing two stents in my brain. WP was there for the whole thing).   
  
Im really sick right now. The hospital blew me off even though some of the scans indicated diverticulitis. Hurricane Helene decimated my area. My ex-fiance lives only an hour away but her city is totally fine. 

We still dont even have clean water at my place. I havent even showered. 

I was going to do no-contact for a while and see how things go. But Im really sick and Im desperate for help, and the other person I would normally turn to is my roommate, who is the AP and trying not to take responsibility for it, who I cannot stand and doesnt know nearly as much about my medical stuff. 

I know it says ambivalent about advice but all advice is wanted. Am I crazy? Is this a bad idea??

Finally done….no service again. ,"This weekend, I was at a race in Arizona. My friend had Verizon and could surf. I couldn’t surf at all, and another race person next to me had Spectrum, and she had no service either. 

Luckily I had an AT&T US mobile secondary line. My even having the line, was due to dealing with over a week long outage because of Hurricane Helene. 

There have been other times, where I just couldn’t surf or do anything.

A Mother’s Plea for Help After Hurricane Helene,"I find myself in a position I never imagined I would be in. I am reaching out with a heavy heart, overwhelmed by despair after losing everything in the wake of Hurricane Helene. This storm took not only my home but also my sense of security and stability—everything I worked so hard for was washed away in a matter of hours. I am doing my best to pick up the pieces, but with the chaos left in the storm’s wake, I find myself in urgent need of assistance just to make it through the next couple of weeks. My deepest desire is to return to work to start rebuilding our lives, but I currently lack the funds to cover the hotel expenses for just this short time. With your help, I hope to cover these costs so I can regain my footing and show my daughter that even in the darkest of times, we can rise again.
I am humbly asking for help. Any amount, no matter how small, can make a significant difference as I work towards my goal of securing stable housing and providing for my little girl. I am eternally grateful for any support you can provide—I promise that your kindness will not be forgotten. Thank you for taking the time to read my plea. Your compassion means the world to me and my daughter right now as we navigate through this storm of our lives.

With heartfelt gratitude

"Given any opportunity, MAGA will take away your vote.","

# 

# As reported, the right-wing's MAGA controlled legislature is still considering ways and methods to set aside election results and just award all of North Carolina's electoral votes to Trump. This is the kind of country they are laying the groundwork for. They advocate for a country where, as Trump promised, the Constitution would be invalidated and governance would be controlled by a cadre of insolent and arrogant seditionists, with no input by the voters of the nation.

In their conceit and hubris, they consider themselves to be above you -- all knowing and paternalistic -- and in their authoritarian fever-dream see themselves on high while the underclass, the untouchables, grovel for scraps.

This is the face of fascism, and they make no attempt at hiding it.

Vote now, while you can. Else, the day will come when the niceties disappear, and all decisions will be made by a chosen few.

It happened in Germany, it happened in China, it happened in North Korea, and preparations are now in full swing for it to happen here in North Carolina, and then throughout the nation.

Our only hope is to vote the tyrants out while we can. The must be defeated by an overwhelming margin and then prosecuted for their criminal insurgence so they will never attempt this scheme again.

See this report -- boldface mine.

""Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., chair of the **right-wing House Freedom Caucus**, suggested North Carolina’s **GOP-controlled legislature should declare former President Donald Trump the winner** of the state’s 16 electors **before votes are finalized,** giving credence to the far-flung scheme that drew bipartisan rebuke on Capitol Hill. Harris said Thursday during a Republican Party dinner in Talbot County, Maryland, that it “**makes a lot of sense”** to convene the legislature early to **certify electoral votes for Trump before they’re finalized,** considering that Hurricane Helene may have disenfranchised voters in some counties ravaged by the storm, many of which are heavily Republican.

Harris was responding to a suggestion from pro-Trump activist Ivan Raiklin advocating for North Carolina and other states to certify their election results before they’re finalized “so that those states guarantee that no illegals are voting, no illegal drop boxes, no illegal signature non verifications going on,” he said during the Thursday meeting, according to a video of the remarks he posted to his X account. Harris suggested **the plan was “legitimate” in North Carolina,** given the devastation from Helene, but questioned whether it would work in other states.

Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., chair of the House Administration committee tasked with overseeing election processes, blasted the plan as a “**blood-chilling scheme,”** in a statement to Politico, adding **“extreme Republican leaders are openly advocating that North Carolina’s electoral votes be given to Donald Trump without an election.”** Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., told reporters Friday he hadn’t heard about the plans discussed in Talbot County but that “it makes no sense whatsoever to prejudge the election outcome. And that is a misinformed view of what is happening on the ground in North Carolina, bless his heart.”

16. That’s how many electoral votes belong to North Carolina, one of the seven swing states that will decide the election. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are locked in a dead heat there, with Five Thirty Eight’s polling average showing Trump leading by 1.3 points.

**Trump and his allies appear to be gearing up to contest the results of the 2024 election if Trump loses.** While Trump has said he hasn’t seen any signs of fraud so far in the election process and has encouraged his supporters to vote early, he has also said Harris can’t win unless Democrats cheat. **Republicans have already filed a slew of election-related legal challenges this cycle.**

I’m scared about my future.,"I’m in my early 30s and I’m scared that I’m not going to live a secure life. I have a decent job but I have struggled with housing insecurity for years now because I’m from a city with a very high cost of living. I was recently affected by hurricane Helene after trying to start new in a new state and it’s left me feeling so lost and discouraged. I was living with a roommate but the house we were in was inadequate for many reasons that were exacerbated by the hurricane aftermath, so we left that apartment and my roommate moved in with someone she is seeing because her income was affected by the storm.

Now I’m in between crashing a friends places, in a high cost city (put everything in storage and drove back to my home state), not knowing what to do or where to go. I could move to a cheaper city on my own but I don’t think I’m in a good mental space to be in a city where I don’t know anyone. But living alone and paying so much rent that I won’t be able to save much money also feels like a bad option.

 I haven’t been able to take care of myself enough to have a stable home for longer than a year or two. I feel like giving up because it’s just so defeating doing all of this on my own and still ending up in really shitty housing situations.

It’s been so hard to stay afloat with little to no support. The world feels harder to live in every day and I’m basically hanging on by one thread that is my remote job. I can’t even move back in with my parents to reduce some burdens for a while.

Just feels impossible to make it through this life with almost no support. Specially when I’ve already been through so much and feeing beyond burnt out.

I’m feeling so lost and I don’t know how to get out of this loop of disastrous living situations. I don’t know what do when I feel like I really just need help that I can’t get. I don’t know how people keep going like this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1gd9z9u/im_scared_about_my_future/,1730032575.0,nugloomfi,AskWomenOver30,"[{'Comment Author': 'sunflowerdisaster12', 'Comment Body': ""I'm so sorry for what you're going through!

Concerns about flooded vehicles from a hurricane prone dealer,"Admittedly: this is more fictional than anything but it’s a legit concern I have.

I’m considering buying a CPO vehicle from a dealership that’s in the SW Florida area. Think Hurricane Helene/Milton area.

I’m sorry if I’m being a cynical prick, but how could I be sure that I’m not being sold a vehicle that was flooded/ had water damage?",https://www.reddit.com/r/askcarsales/comments/1gd1bx4/concerns_about_flooded_vehicles_from_a_hurricane/,1729996981.0,CubanInSouthFl,askcarsales,"[{'Comment Author': 'NemesisOfZod', 'Comment Body': ""A branded dealership isn't risking their status to sell *you* a car.""}, {'Comment Author': 'RexRaider', 'Comment Body': 'Here are some tips to keep in mind:\n\n\n--\n\nSmell for odors: It’s hard to get the smell of musty carpets and water-logged seat padding out of a car. If you detect an odor, this could be a good indication that stagnant water has sat in the car for a considerable amount of time. On the other hand, if the car is heavily scented with a strong air freshener or cleaner, then you should always be cautious as this could be masking something.\n\n--\n\nInvestigate the interior: Pull back the carpets to look for lingering mud, dirt and water stains. You should also check the trunk for water lines, leftover silt or rust. If the carpets and upholstery appear as though they’ve been replaced recently or look too new for an older car model, this could be another red flag.\n\n--\n\nLook for condensation: Check the dashboard for condensation as there could be moisture lingering in the instrument panels. Water can fry your vehicle’s accessories so you’ll also want to test all of these – dashboard lights, wipers, signal lights, radio, heater, air conditioner and any other switches or options – to make sure they are all in working order.\n\n--\n\nTake a closer look at the little details: Have a look around the car and scrutinize the hard to reach areas and nooks and crannies. Keep an eye out for dried mud, salt stains, rusted bolts, brittle wiring or even mold in areas that never completely dried out.\n\n--\n\nGet a pre-purchase inspection: Take your vehicle to a licensed mechanic for a thorough pre-purchase inspection. This inspection will determine the cosmetic, mechanical and safety condition of the car and can let you know if there is any water damage internally. This is important because while the car may seem perfect on the outside, saltwater or water damage can have lingering effects on the car’s braking, steering and electrical systems. It can take months for this corrosive damage to occur so while the car may be functioning just fine during your test drive, down the road you could run into serious problems. Your mechanic will be able to let you know what’s going on underneath the hood so you don’t have any surprises after you’ve purchased the car.'}, {'Comment Author': 'AutoModerator', 'Comment Body': 'Please review our most [Frequently Asked Questions](/r/askcarsales/wiki/index) to see if your question has already been answered.\n\nYou may find these sections particularly useful;\n\n* [How to pick a car?](/r/askcarsales/wiki/vehicle_selection) You might also have luck in the /r/whatcarshouldibuy subreddit. \n\nAlso remember to add flair to your post by clicking the ""Flair"" link beneath it.

Dealing with trauma post-disaster ,"While I’d rather be anywhere but here in this sub at the moment, I’m realizing I need to find ways to deal with this anxiety. I live in WNC and have been here throughout all of hurricane helene. I was alone in my apartment, just me in my pets, for a week and a half, so afraid at first we wouldn’t be able to get enough food or water. We had no power for 13 days, no cell service at all for 3 so I truly had no way to know if my parents who were trapped by fallen trees were alive or not. We had no running water for almost 3 weeks. Several towns are now gone, and reading yesterday that had the dam near me failed, I would likely be dead along with everyone in its path has just worsened my PTSD anxiety to a level it hasn’t been in a long time. I’m also a nurse at the hospital here and was back at work the Monday after it hit, so not even a break. We didn’t have running water there so we bathed using buckets. Work is still the only place I can get a shower. 

I am anxious about everything now. I go from obsessing over what if my pets and I had drowned along with tens of thousands of people to panic about the election (which was already stressful) to panic about things just so far out of my control it’s crazy. I did okay during the disaster, somewhat, but it’s just all hit me and I am trying to cope. Sleeping is proving pretty difficult with nightmares about drowning. How can I ever feel safe in my home again? 

I have an appointment with a therapist this coming week and I don’t even know how to talk about it. Condensing my OCD/PTSD history and explaining how I feel now just seems so overwhelming but I know I need to go. My anxiety now that the gravity of the situation is hitting is just awful. I don’t want to be crying a couple times a day and afraid to sleep in case something happens. Even light rain is terrifying for us now—it starts and my friends are panicking too because the last time it really rained left whole towns as rubble and killed so many people. 

Thanks for reading—any suggestions as to ways to relax and cope temporarily would be wonderful. I will keep my therapy appointment and I’ve also ordered a trauma journal too. I appreciate anyone who read this.

Straight Talk Home Internet Review,"I recently faced internet issues due to Hurricane Helene, which left my Spectrum service out of commission. After power was restored, I found myself without internet and uncertain about when it would be back. Thankfully, after searching for alternatives, I discovered Straight Talk Home Internet.

I checked several Walmart locations and eventually drove an hour to find one that had it in stock. The installation was incredibly straightforward, and within minutes, I was back online—much easier than my previous experiences with one of the major cellular internet providers.

Now, three weeks in, I can’t praise the service enough! My speeds have been consistently impressive at 195-200 Mbps down and 15-20 Mbps up. For the price, it’s an unbeatable deal! I’m seriously considering canceling my Spectrum service entirely. Highly recommend Straight Talk Home Internet! And No Contract!

Major disappointment,"Hi, throwaway account here because I’m so ashamed. I have been on the 0.25 dosage for a few weeks. I was doing very well on it and lost almost 8lbs and then disaster hit. My family was heavily affected by hurricane Helene and then my parents were directly hit by hurricane Milton. I began to eat badly because of the pure stress and anxiety. I now feel as though my sema is just not working at all, all my food noise is back and I feel like a failure. I’ve gained all 8lbs back plus a couple more. I’m due to order my next dose of Sema on the 1st which will be 0.5mg. Is the higher dosage possibly going to help with the food noise like the original starter dose did? Sorry for the rant, I just had to get it out and I’m so disappointed and upset with myself.

♦️♦️HURRICANE RELIEF♦️♦️ ,"Help TGI Fridays Asheville Employees Rebuild After Hurricane Helene

Hi everyone,

I'm reaching out on behalf of my colleagues and myself—loyal employees of TGI Fridays in Asheville, North Carolina. Many of us dedicated years, some even decades, to this location. I’ve personally worked here for 7 years, and several of my coworkers have put in 23–24 years of service. Sadly, Hurricane Helene devastated Asheville, and the company decided to close this location permanently. This decision was a shock to all of us, as we were left without support or a clear plan for what’s next.

Our team is like family, and we’re turning to the community for help during this difficult time. We’ve set up a GoFundMe to help cover basic living expenses, rent, and medical needs as we navigate this sudden loss of income. Any support, whether through donations or even just spreading the word, would mean the world to us.

Thank you for reading, and thank you to anyone who’s able to lend a hand.

Solar Generator from Sam’s Club - thoughts?,"Hey y’all! I think this might be my first post here. Maybe not but I figured this would be the best place to ask about this. Normally I think to post in Prepper fb groups but lately people have been rude as hell, nasty, and just encapsulating the personality of a stale fart with each-other. I hope to find kinder mentalities here with my fellow Two XXers. 

What are your thoughts on this? I’ve been eyeballing a solar one for a bit. We have a gas/propane one that powered us during Hurricane Helene and Milton outages (west coast central FL.) It’s 6250 watts running and it powered almost the whole house minus the AC, and we elected to not run our range/stove and fridge with the ice maker machine (garage fridge was a wayyyy less power draw.)

 With every event like this you learn something new. We saw some serious fuel usage concerns with it and the local area, we didn’t fly thru fuel as we were hyper aware and conservative but the local area couldn’t get fuel for a few days due to Port Tampa being down, and people really showed their asses here. We had 25 gallons of gas ready and 3 standard propane tanks. Plus 8 baby propane tanks for the Coleman camp stove. But it did start to make me a little nervous to acknowledge we had used 1 and a half 5 gallon containers over about 2 and a half days with conservative rotation (keeping freezers and fridge cool, our bearded dragon’s light on, and the well cycled for our livestock primarily.) 

We did use our inverter and batteries to keep our bearded dragon’s light on, but noticed it drew quickly. So I’m considering other ways to power his light when we want to give the fuel burner a break. We have a big solar panel and set up to charge those batteries but as I mentioned above, we learned how quickly some of those drained. So then this guy popped up on my radar today while online grocery shopping, after I had been eyeballing some on Amazon.

Figured it would be a good idea to ask the hive mind, what you think of this little gadget for the arsenal! It would be nice to be able to power small things at night too from inside the house, as we shut it off and rolled it in at night to prevent theft. 

Thanks in advance!

And eco flow does a lot of great stuff with software and how they build/package their devices. \n\nSolar generators are fantastic but need to know their limitations and what power draw you’ll do to scale up or down. Bigger systems will have a higher inverter power draw so they’ll lose more power at idle when on, but they can handle bigger loads too. Smaller units are fantastic for portability and running small things with little power draw.

SUNDAY 1 to 7pm. Free clothing swap and coat drive,"**Into the Wardrobe: Burnwear Exchange/Coat & Winter Supply Drive

Please join us as Go Frock Yourself pops up once again, this time in downtown Durham. In addition to hosting spoils of eclectic outfits and costumes to refresh your wardrobe, we will be collecting donations for those impacted by Hurricane Helene. This is a free event.

We’ll have friends, old and new, music, hot spiced cider, snacks, and scads of free stuff. Come meet, greet, and score big. BYOB and anything you’d like to share. Bring a chair, if you’d like - this is a bright and lofty unfurnished space

Ours is not your everyday clothing swap. We encourage you to bring intentional gifts of apparel and accessories that inspire and delight, but you need not bring anything at all. All flavors of fun, fierce, and fabulous welcome. Please leave the normcore, office casual, and nasty t-shirts at home. Further details and guidelines to come in the comments.

For donation, we are seeking coats, jackets, blankets, sleeping bags, raingear, hats, scarves, gloves, thermals, new socks, new underwear, diapers, and incontinence and menstrual supplies. Donations will be directed to WNC through Triangle Mutual Aid. (See comments for a link to updating list of requests.) No donation is required to participate in the swap!

The venue is a second-floor commercial space accessible by the alley on Orange Street between W. Parrish and Chapel Hill Streets. Street parking and the Chapel Hill Street deck/lot are free on Sunday. 

Warm fuzzies will abound! See you there!

Fall lawn renovation “complete”,"We bought our house (zone 8a btw) this summer and lawn was in decent shape but it was mostly weeds/mixed grass types and I wanted TTTF so we started the rigorous process of renovating our lawn. At a point now where I think I can post a renovation complete update even though I know it will never fully be complete. Here was my process:

1. Started nuking my lawn first week of September with glysophate (I pretty much kept my dogs inside/walked them a lot since the start of this project to avoid unwanted chemicals, prevent them getting muddy, and killing the new grass). Grass was pretty much dead after a couple of weeks.
2. Scalped lawn, scarify which helped bring the lawn to bare dirt, and aerated using a rental from Lowe’s
3. Brought in a tri-axle load of topsoil to do some leveling work and add nutrients back into the soil. This was by far the hardest and most time consuming part since my lawn is just under 10k sqft would not recommend lol. 
4. Threw down about 90lbs of TTTF from GCI as well as about 25lbs of Johnathan Green dense shade mix around the trees. Raked it then rolled it in but did not throw any pete moss on top. Having some sort of cover probably would have been helpful but would have costed way too much for roughly 10k sqft so I just made sure that the seed was well incorporated into the dirt.
5. Added some starter fertilizer and then just watered it like crazy. Fortunately, I work from home so I could go out and water the areas that the sprinkler couldn’t reach. I used a couple of orbit timers that I set to run every 6 hours but would also manually run them on some of the hotter days at peak temps.

The bad:
Hurricane Helene came through the weekend after I threw down the seed and had some major wash out (as you can see from the picture of a river running through my back yard). All things considered I am pretty fortunate that it did not do any more damage other than a bit of seed washing into my neighbor’s lawn. Still meant that I had to buy another 45lb bag of seed and fix all the washout areas. There are still quite a few bare patches that I am just gonna have to accept and fix next year. And yes I checked the weather beforehand, did not realized it was gonna hit us that hard but you live and you learn.

STOBETTER S4E3: Heritage and Hangar Bays,"Hello, and welcome to our penultimate update for the year. This time, we’re featuring content from the Heritage bundle, updated builds and guides based on hangar research, and a slew of other new content to explore. 

If you’re new to our site, our goal is to be the best resource for STO combat mechanics information anywhere and a top-tier guides/build resource for PvE gameplay on both space and ground from level 50 to 1.5M DPS. Our core competencies are mechanical knowledge, process, tools, and technical writing/presentation. Shipbuilding is an application of that knowledge, but we're also not trying to chase the peak ISE/HSE/BHE meta super hard. As always, you can find us at: https://www.stobetter.com

#Builds

##Jay

* [Durgath](https://www.stobetter.com/intro-builds/jay/kinetic-durgath) *It’s been a loooong time, getting from there to here. It’s been a loooong road, but the Durgath is finally here*. (*Editor’s Note: I thought we said he was no longer allowed to sing!*)

* [Friendship](https://www.stobetter.com/intro-builds/jay/carrier-friendship) Jay has been keeping up with all of the new carrier toys and now his Friendship is the highest-performing carrier we’ve personally seen or flown with at 1177K, with over 55% from pets.

* The [Hydra](https://www.stobetter.com/intro-builds/jay/ss-hydra) slept silent for awhile, allowing a RRTW build to shine as our energy leader, but now it has awoken and reclaimed the energy DPS site record at 1400K. Hail Hydra!

* [Atlantis](https://www.stobetter.com/intro-builds/jay/bo-atlantis) Jay has his first midrange build and it’s a newer concept for him, Beam Overload on the Atlantis

##Eph289

* I’ve hinted at this already on reddit several times, but I have actually built a real carrier this time on the [Herald Vonph](https://www.stobetter.com/intro-builds/eph289/carrier-vonph). I’ve had a Vonph collecting dust for years and this was a good opportunity to take all my collected carrier knowledge and put it to use with new content from the Heritage bundle. It’s up to 1072K, of which over half of that damage is from pets

* The [Eagle](https://www.stobetter.com/intro-builds/eph289/kinetic-eagle) is now up to 1536K with some new toys from the Heritage bundle and is our first build to crack 1.5M DPS. 

* The [Support Hiawatha](https://www.stobetter.com/intro-builds/eph289/support-hiawatha) is now freshly refitted with the Subspace Fracture Tunneling Field console for even more cooldowns and is up to  244K / 531% debuff

* My [ERL Gagarin](https://www.stobetter.com/intro-builds/eph289/erl-achilles) has been transferred to the Achilles and, now with Hexa-cannons, is our first ERL build above 1M DPS at 1019K.

##Tilor

* With the release of the [Typhon](https://www.stobetter.com/intro-builds/tilor/kinetic-typhon), we finally have an Economy-tier Torper on our site. While not quite the highest-DPS of our Economy line of builds, it’s not far off at 840k. It’s not quite a carrier build, but could be a stepping stone in that direction.

* Tilor’s [Tzen-tar](https://www.stobetter.com/intro-builds/tilor/kinetic-tzen-tar) is now his highest DPS ship at 1338K and sporting some shiny new upgrades.

#[Editorials](https://www.stobetter.com/editorials)

We’re adding this section to help explain stances/decisions we’re making. For example, why we’re testing on solo ISA, why we don’t use the Fleet Power Network Array, and what we’re doing about Tilor’s reddit being gone.

#Feedback Form

The list of dropdowns was getting unsustainably long, so we’ve condensed it. Yay, no more doomscrolling!

#Guides

* [Carrier Basics](https://www.stobetter.com/new-f2p/carrier-basics) has had some nominal updates to account for new heritage bundle content and point to the tier lists

* [Progression](https://www.stobetter.com/guides/progression) has been updated for Heritage/13th bundle content and a Carrier section

* All the [Revisiting Exotics](https://www.stobetter.com/guides/revisiting-exotics) are now under Guides and Tilor did some cleanup on them to condense them.

#ICYMI

* [Revisiting Exotics 23](https://www.reddit.com/r/stobuilds/comments/1g23lz5/revisiting_exotics_23_captain_proton_and_lolah/) covers a couple of newer Proton consoles and Cascading Gravimetric Disruptions.

* [Mathbusters 9: Advanced Cooldowns and Uncon](https://www.reddit.com/r/stobuilds/comments/1dquarf/mathbusters_9_advanced_cooldowns_and_uncon/) covered cooldown mechanics for channels and Unconventional Systems (Editor’s Note: it does not cover Subspace Fracture Tunneling Field, aka Vovin console)

* [Mathbusters 10: Heritage Bundle Pet Testing](https://www.reddit.com/r/stobuilds/comments/1emkud0/mathbusters_10_heritage_bundle_pet_testing/)

* [Torpedo Effects and Damage 7: Event Torpedoes and Ship Consoles](https://www.reddit.com/r/stobuilds/comments/1evg75j/torpedo_effects_and_damage_7_event_torpedoes_and/)

#[Tier Lists](https://www.stobetter.com/tier-lists)

* We have a Carrier Starship Trait / Personal Trait / Duty Officer section of the tier list now (doffs are really just Flight Deck Officers)

* We have updated the survivability doff tier list slightly for Dal R’el and the Na’kuhl space warfare specialist for exotic builds (is quite good actually)

* We have updated the tier list for traits from the Heritage bundle as well

* We revamped our presentation of carrier pets as well to clean it up and added data for Elite Type 7s and Elite Valors

#[Tools](https://www.stobetter.com/tools)

* With thanks to /u/ShmooDude993, we have updated the CDR tool to better account for channel cooldowns and fix some errors, now up to version 3.9. 

* TRINITY -  a handful of new exotic consoles from Revisiting Exotics 23, Temporal Tunneling, Portal of the Damned, and Flagship Staffing. We also added Breen 2-and-3 piece and corrected an issue where manual override of uptimes wasn’t working, applied -DRR from DRB correctly and fixed its cooldown.  Now at version 1.7

* ALICIA - Added consoles from the Achilles, Lo’laH, Premonition, Vovin, Obelisk Carrier, Friendship, and the Pahvan Crystal Battery. Now at version 0.9.1.

#[Printables](https://www.stobetter.com/guides/printables)

Tilor has updated his printable for boff cooldowns with a few minor updates to cooldowns. There’s also a new printable on Upgrades! This should be your go-to guide for the best way to upgrade your gear.

#[Videos](https://www.youtube.com/@stobetter)

* We’ve added tutorials for Gateway to Gre’thor, Brotherhood of the Sword, and some bonus videos showing how we do our testing. Also, Tilor posted a Fractal Integrity Bleed build breakdown for maximum hull-scaling damage and an upgrade video. 

#Thanks

Our continued thanks for members outside the immediate team who nevertheless have contributed immeasurably to our success:

* Everyone who has donated to Tilor to help him and his family recover from Hurricane Helene. 

* Mrs. Eph289, who’s been supportive of a lot of gaming and spreadsheet time, and has been flying support to help us push our builds. You remain my favorite captain to fly with, forever!

* Our good friend Grim, who has been such a huge help!

* Our fleetmates in Zion Fleet/Terran Imperial Guard who accompany us on our hijinks, specifically Mickster

* /u/DivisionMuEpsilon, who helped teach us how to use the Vovin console and has been flying with us some as well

* /u/Pottsey-X5 who's clued us in to several new toys our carriers have benefitted from

#Giveaways

As a way of saying thanks to all of you who supported Mr. Tilor and his family during recovery, we have some giveaways to offer. To enter, either leave a comment on the reddit thread or send us a Google form response with the keyword “Helene” in it. We’ll draw winners in 2 weeks on 9 November!

* 1 Infinity Prize Pack (T5) - keyword T5, not T6

* 1 Mk XV Epic Plasma Isomag

* Romulan Survivor Duty Officer Pack

* 1 Mk XV Epic Disruptor Hangar Craft Power Transmission

* 4 Lockbox keys

#What’s Next

I’m itching to start optimizing my other two Exotic builds with some new toys and still have a handful of builds to X2, update, and re-test. Look for updates to the Damar, Dranuur, Support Scimitar, and Lexington next time. Tilor is building out an Economy-tier tank. Jay has some older builds he wants to update.  For TFO tutorials, we’ll be tackling Khitomer Vortex, and a TFO of YOUR CHOICE to finish out the year. Fill out the [survey](https://forms.gle/KmDYa7EMy9rr84aG7) to vote. It’ll remain open until the end of the month!

Lessons from Helene,"I live just outside Asheville and thought I would share some prepping lessons from Hurricane Helene. I don’t consider myself an advanced prepper but having spent a career in the military and having lived in hurricane zones I know the importance of some preparation. 

What worked well:
1.  Having a small inverter generator to keep the refrigerator and chest freezer running. My Westinghouse i2200  burns very little fuel and is relatively quiet. We used it for some other minor things as well and it performed flawlessly. 
2. Having a small solar generator to power electronics, a fan, and a dc light. I originally got it to keep the internet running but we lost internet access. So I used it to power a small TV with an OTA antenna. That and an AM radio were our only sources of information.
3. Having a camping stove and a battery powered camping shower made life much easier.
4. Having gas, food and batteries on hand was helpful. I also used my Dewalt and Metabo work lights at night since I had several batteries for each.
5. Not having to do any shopping for a week saved much frustration. There were long lines and limited supplies for the first few days. Also, many places could only take cash.

What I need to improve:
1. You can never have too much water on hand. I had a little over 70 gallons, not counting bottled water and gallon size jugs of water.  Part of my long term plan was to capture rain water and filter it. I don’t have a permanent system but have tarps I can set up on a temporary basis. Only problem was that it didn’t rain for weeks after the storm. The Asheville water system had previously only been down for 3 days max during the 2004 storms. 
2. Don’t underestimate any storm. I could see the evidence two days ahead but for some reason I underestimated this storm. It was an error in judgment, previous history in this area and the amount of rain we got before the hurricane should have made me realize what could happen. 


Edit: I should add for those not aware that the Asheville water system was totally out of commission for three weeks. Once water started flowing again it was and still is non potable. They are basically sending water straight from the reservoir into the pipes and adding some chlorine. It’s bypassing the treatment plant because of all the sediment. We have no idea when we’ll get potable water again.

Please assist my Godparents’ during this trying time ,"My name is Hayden H. The purpose of this is to raise as much money as I can for my beloved godparents, Steph and Sam Tate. Earlier this year, my godfather retired after dedicating 35 years of service to the U.S. Navy. Never could they fathom that they would be rebuilding their forever home, instead of vacationing.

They have been devastated and displaced from their home in Spartanburg, South Carolina due to Hurricane Helene’s wrath. The flooding has destroyed mostly everything inside—furniture, clothing, and irreplaceable personal effects—and now they’re facing the overwhelming task of rebuilding their home and lives.

Unfortunately, my godparents didn’t have flood insurance. The financial burden is immense, with repair costs expected to range from $15,000 to $75,000, in addition to the expenses of temporary housing and replacing everything they've lost. Preserving and starting the cleanup process, the journey ahead will be challenging. I’m asking for your help to raise $75,000 to cover these urgent costs and give my godparents a safe place to live again.

Any contribution you can make, big or small, will go a long way in helping my godparents rebuild their forever home. Every little bit counts! Also, sharing this campaign with your network would also mean the world!

Looking for seeds and want to help support WNC?,"Hi everyone! (Mods, please feel free to remove if this isn’t allowed) I’m an Asheville NC local and have been gardening for about 5 years now. I wanted to share a local Asheville/WNC business that I personally purchase my seeds + bulbs from. They are donating 20% of their profits to Hurricane Helene Relief from now until November 15th. If you are wanting seeds, gifts, anything gardening related I cannot recommend this place enough. Their seed & bulb quality is exceptional (just got some garlic & shallots from them). Not to mention they are employee owned and an excellent resource for gardening in our community. WNC is still in very rough shape. Anything helps.

Hurricane paths and the future,"I live in western north carolina smack dab in the middle of the path of hurricane Helene. I've had a lot of thoughts and conversations along a similar vein that I've found myself thinking I really wish I knew some one that knew about meteorology, and then I remembered the internet exists. 

The biggest thing I'd love to hear thoughts on is, could this happen again. With so much talk about how this is truly unprecedented, and a once in a thousand year storm, it's hard for me to believe that climate change couldn't just throw those thoughts out the window.  I've heard plenty of talk about climate change making hurricanes more powerful and frequent but can things like shifting ocean currents make certain paths like smack dab into the mountains a more regular thing? Is this something that's being talked about and predicted or are we just truly in a wait and see situation?

Thanks in advance and I look forward to yalls thoughts!

This means storms may have impacts further into land, if they happen to drift that way. We are putting more energy into the system, but can't predict where it'll be better or worse.\n\nRain bomb type storms will always spell trouble for upper drainage basin communities like those affected by Helene. We are making it easier for water to gang up, basically.""}, {'Comment Author': 'Alternative_Talk562', 'Comment Body': ""Based on history, it can absolutely happen again. It happened in 1916 and 1940. \n\nWe are having wetter storms, like the recent floods in Tennessee and Kentucky that dropped more than a foot of rain.  \n\nAnd with warming, Gulf storms are forecast to get wetter. They haven't really developed yet a number for how much wetter the limit could be.""}, {'Comment Author': 'Cool_Roof2453', 'Comment Body': 'It’s important to remember that a 1 in 1000 or 1 in 100 year storm is a reference to probability, as based on historical conditions. \n\nSo for a 1 in 2 year storm, you are tossing a coin each year with a 50/50 chance of getting that storm. \n\nFor a 1 in 6 year storm, imagine you’re throwing a six sided die. You throw that die each year. If you roll a 1, big storm. It might take 10 throws (10 years) or it might only take two. \n\nFor a 1 in 20 year storm think of rolling a 1 on a 20 sided D and D die. Doesn’t happen often but really sucks when it does, you take that chance every time you roll. Can it happen a few times in a row?  Not likely but certainly possible. \n\nUnder known historical conditions for a 1 in 1000 year storm, a 1000 sided die gets rolled each year.\n\nUnfortunately climate change is changing the baseline conditions and nobody really knows yet what new dice are being rolled in the game.'}, {'Comment Author': 'MaverickFegan', 'Comment Body': 'The statistics are a difficult one to quantify, 1/1000 events are only valid based on what we know now. \n\nThere’s a good example of the early use of statistics and forecasting hurricane track/intensity in the book Isaac’s Storm by Erik Larson, which build up to the 1900 Hurricane that hit Galveston. There is an example in there about earlier hurricanes defying statistics, it’s also interesting to read about the decision making, the way people reacted, the impacts which were pretty horrific. \n\nFrom my own experience of hurricane season there were many hurricanes that we worried about but only one that hit, we have to prepare for the storm as the difference between a windy day with blue skies and a hurricane is often a comparatively small change that is hard to quantify when you are just a small point on a map.

It was a strong hurricane  \n2.) Very large size, which meant more moisture and more energy  \n3.) Fast forward speed, which allowed these to persist farther inland than normal before weakening.  \n4.) An interaction with a cutoff low which caused the hurricane to stall after landfall and hover over one area.\n\nClimate change has been researched to be linked with 3/4 of these factors.  \n1.) A higher percentage of future hurricanes will reach category 4/5 strength as well. Computer simulations have estimated that climate change was responsible for an additional \\~10 mph of strength in Helene compared to how strong the hurricane would have been in a pre-industrial environment. The average landfalling hurricane will become more destructive in the future.  \n2.) Hurricanes will become larger and wetter. Warmer air can hold more moisture. Warmer water fuels increased convection. This will continue increasing the amount of energy in the atmosphere that a hurricane has to work with, and thus will result in increased rainfall as well as larger/stronger storms. Large wet hurricanes can cause much more flooding.  \n3.) Helene's fast forward speed was an anomaly. The long-term trend is actually for slower-moving hurricanes. Hurricanes like Harvey, Florence, and Dorian which stall at landfall are going to become increasingly common, as opposed to hurricanes which are booking it at landfall like Helene.  \n4.) As just mentioned, stalling after landfall will grow increasingly common. It won't always be due to a cutoff low like Helene, but this inland stalling, regardless of their cause, means significantly enhanced risk of flooding due to tropical rains parking over the same area for multiple days.  \n\\[So, conflicting factors between those final 2 things.\\]""}, {'Comment Author': 'jimb2', 'Comment Body': 'Storm formation, development, intensity and path is down to a lot of factors so has a high level of randomness.  That\'s the key to understanding.  There are physical factors that make storms more likely in some places than others but what actually happens is effectively random.  So, big storms are not likely but they equally likely any year.  Like if you throw six heads in a row, the chance of the next throw being heads is just one half, like any other throw.   That\'s just how random works.\n\nA ""one in a thousand year storm"" is a bit poetic, of course.  It\'s just a Big Number, not a real analysis.  There are good reasons to believe that global warming will increase frequency and intensity of these extreme events, so the past may not be a good guide to the future.  People want to ascribe individual events to global warming but this is basically wrong-headed.  Thinking in terms of chance or frequency is more realistic.'}, {'Comment Author': 'fatalexe', 'Comment Body': 'It was pretty bad back when I lived in Asheville for the 2004 hurricane caused flood.

What kind of pest might this be. ,"Hi, everyone. I’ve found these slightly rice sized pellets under the bathroom sink (2 bedroom 2 bathroom single family home). There were about three to four of them in the cabinet. Wondering if it could be rodents or insects. Saw one large roach (not sure what kind, but it wasn’t a water bug, and it was somewhat resistant to Raid spray) in the same bathroom about 3 weeks ago. We usually don’t see these kinds of insects, and although I use an insecticide spray and clean routinely, I know that pests are still a possibility. We live in the southeast(GA), and our area was hit hard by Hurricane Helene. I plan on calling an exterminator. I’m wondering how much to expect to pay. Is there a difference in strategy for rodents vs. insects? Could I identify and solve the issue myself? Should I tell my wife about all of this?

Vizio M512 Soundbar and Sub issue,"I have a less than 2 year M512 Vizio soundbar system. I got flooded in hurricane Helene and my sub got salt water in it, not good. Dried it out but no power on the sub.  
  
So, like I have done before with other Vizio systems I bought a used M512 Sub on ebay. I found out after many, many hours with Vizio support that these systems are now paired in the factory. No way to pair non matching serial numbers.  
  
Has anyone been able to find a work around or hack that works? Or is there something inside the damaged sub that I can bring over to the used sub to get them to pair?  
  
Hate that you can no longer buy a used part an get it to work with the M series. And I hate to use this system without the sub and satellite speakers.  
  
Soundbar works fine and I can not update the firmware because it needs to update the sub too and if it does not pair then... it just sits there.  
  
Anyone have any ideas?

Things woke redditors were saying two months ago,"We've locked up the White House for Obama's fourth term. 

Voters are going to support Kamala just because she's a black woman and endorsed by Taylor Swift. All we have to do is blame Trump for everything, make promises we can't keep and tell people that Kamala is all about hope and change we can believe in. 

We also will keep the media away unless they agree to give her softball questions that are pre-approved or selected by her campaign. That is a smart idea because voters will see what we want them to see. They will forget that Kamala let in 11,000,000 illegals, let inflation and cost of living go sky high, got the nomination after staging a coup and literally got zero primary votes, created more wars, did nothing on climate change, helped the rich get richer, etc. because we will pretend it never happened.

We are also going to make Kamala likable by gaslighting. For example, we will stage a picture of her pretending to be working on Hurricane Helene relief on AF1 and people will forget that she skipped every hurricane preparedness meeting that she was assigned to go.

We also going to make her look smart by encouraging her word salads and wagging her finger in people's faces while rolling her neck.

White men will fall in line to support her as along as we get a white male running mate who put tampons in the boys locker room like Tim Walz. We'll also stage some videos of Walz pretending to hunt or fixing his car. Then we'll have Kamala pretending to drink a beer on those woke late night talk shows that are so popular with working class Americans. If that fails, then bring out Lizzo who will tell them that Kamala wants to turn their small towns into Detroit.

We're going to win bigly. We're going to win Texas and Florida too. Kamala is our Messiah.

Being in a hurricane impacted area with Contamination OCD,"So I’m in western NC dealing with the aftermath of hurricane Helene currently. Our water source is contaminated and there is a shit ton of dis/mis information spreading around about it and it’s really like an intrusive thought come to reality.

I was in remisssion for the last few years and this has kicked it off full force. I’m just stressed as I know I can’t change the situation. 

I feel that “what if” paranoia creeping up daily and it’s exhausting. 

Just tired and frustrated and sad from all of this.

Trying to accept the things I cannot change and move on but that EDP/ACT tool that I once had mastered is now so intangible.

"Given any opportunity, MAGA will take away your vote.","# As reported, the right-wing's MAGA controlled legislature is still considering ways and methods to set aside election results and just award all of North Carolina's electoral votes to Trump. This is the kind of country they are laying the groundwork for. They advocate for a country where, as Trump promised, the Constitution would be invalidated and governance would be controlled by a cadre of insolent and arrogant seditionists, with no input by the voters of the nation.

In their conceit and hubris, they consider themselves to be above you -- all knowing and paternalistic -- and in their authoritarian fever-dream see themselves on high while the underclass, the untouchables, grovel for scraps.

This is the face of fascism, and they make no attempt at hiding it.

Vote now, while you can. Else, the day will come when the niceties disappear, and all decisions will be made by a chosen few.

It happened in Germany, it happened in China, it happened in North Korea, and preparations are now in full swing for it to happen here in North Carolina, and then throughout the nation.

Our only hope is to vote the tyrants out while we can. The must be defeated by an overwhelming margin and then prosecuted for their criminal insurgence so they will never attempt this scheme again.

See this report -- boldface mine.

""Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., chair of the **right-wing House Freedom Caucus**, suggested North Carolina’s **GOP-controlled legislature should declare former President Donald Trump the winner** of the state’s 16 electors **before votes are finalized,** giving credence to the far-flung scheme that drew bipartisan rebuke on Capitol Hill. Harris said Thursday during a Republican Party dinner in Talbot County, Maryland, that it “**makes a lot of sense”** to convene the legislature early to **certify electoral votes for Trump before they’re finalized,** considering that Hurricane Helene may have disenfranchised voters in some counties ravaged by the storm, many of which are heavily Republican.

Harris was responding to a suggestion from pro-Trump activist Ivan Raiklin advocating for North Carolina and other states to certify their election results before they’re finalized “so that those states guarantee that no illegals are voting, no illegal drop boxes, no illegal signature non verifications going on,” he said during the Thursday meeting, according to a video of the remarks he posted to his X account. Harris suggested **the plan was “legitimate” in North Carolina,** given the devastation from Helene, but questioned whether it would work in other states.

Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., chair of the House Administration committee tasked with overseeing election processes, blasted the plan as a “**blood-chilling scheme,”** in a statement to Politico, adding **“extreme Republican leaders are openly advocating that North Carolina’s electoral votes be given to Donald Trump without an election.”** Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., told reporters Friday he hadn’t heard about the plans discussed in Talbot County but that “it makes no sense whatsoever to prejudge the election outcome. And that is a misinformed view of what is happening on the ground in North Carolina, bless his heart.”

16. That’s how many electoral votes belong to North Carolina, one of the seven swing states that will decide the election. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are locked in a dead heat there, with Five Thirty Eight’s polling average showing Trump leading by 1.3 points.

**Trump and his allies appear to be gearing up to contest the results of the 2024 election if Trump loses.** While Trump has said he hasn’t seen any signs of fraud so far in the election process and has encouraged his supporters to vote early, he has also said Harris can’t win unless Democrats cheat. **Republicans have already filed a slew of election-related legal challenges this cycle.**

For years, Harris touted his father in glowing terms as some find of freedom seeker fleeing “socialism” (in fact, communism, not democratic socialism which thrives in many countries across the globe, UK, Germany, Canada, Australia, etc). But his father, as a distinguished Yale historian who was a real Hungarian hero found last year, was a member of the Hungarian Nazi Party, the awful Arrow Cross movement which was responsible for the slaughter of thousands of Jews.\n\nNow, Harris fans will say, “but you can’t blame the sins of the father on the son.” Oh it is entirely legitimate to force Harris from spreading the lie that Zoltan Harris (just Google “Zoltan Harris and Hungary”), the awful dad, was a democrat (small d). Zoltan Harris fought with the Nazi Army against us and the Allies. Hell, Zoltan Harris, when brought before a Budapest court in 1946, tried to hide his past by joining the Hungarian Communist Party! Fact. And Andy Harris’s claim that the father was in a “Soviet gulag” is too clever by half. He was a legitimate prisoner of war and was in a POW camp. Talk about chutzpah. And then Zoltan Harris skipped Hungary for a displaced person camp in Salzburg, Austria, and then managed to slip into the US.\n\nAnd who does Harris support financially? Well, from his war chest he funded the initial runs for Congress of “Jewish space lasers/QAnon” fan, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, and fellow gun nut, Rep. Lauren Boebert. Talk about extremism.\n\nAnd beware of Ms. Croissette’s artful use of the telling phrase “Constitutional Republic.” This euphemism is a way of trying to sell the lie that we are not a country where the majority of votes decides on who forms the government in the presidency, or Congress. We are a DEMOCRACY. Some smart alecks like Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah suggest that there is nothing wrong with minority rule. Oh, yes there is.\n\nAnd of course Harris supports The Big Lie, an utter sycophant of Trump who just loves Harris.\n\nI could go on at length.\n\nBut let me finish with this.

That's a result of the Party system, which does not exist anywhere in our constitution.\n\nThe process varies party to party as they can make their own rules. Again, no federally controlled process here.\n\nAfter the conception of parties, until 1912, the parties picked their nominee at a caucus with no input from voters.\n\nFrom 1912 to 1968, there was a mix of caucus and elections, entirely so the party could measure popular opinion of the candidates before choosing their nominee. Again, the vote meant fuck all if the party wanted to decide the people chose poorly.\n\nStarting in 1972, after the disaster of the 1968 Democratic Convention, they opted for a more open, electorally binding process. So they wrote their own rules to allow voters to choose their nominee.\n\nin 2024, the nominee who received the most votes **dropped out** after primary voting was largely completed, leaving it up to the Party to determine who to nominate. The party wasn't going to nominate Joe Biden if he declared himself no longer a candidate. There was not enough time, nor support from the States, to hold another election, so they chose a nominee based on major party endorsements.\n\nSo fuck off with this disingenuous, bad faith argument. You just are talking about things you're uneducated in. You're obviously a Trump voter anyway, so why do you care how Democrats choose their nominee? Oh right, because you're sour grapes that a failing candidate got replaced and hurt Trumps chances at winning. Unlike conservatives, we actually can choose not to be stuck with a mistake. You're the ones who are forced to bring these things to term.\n\nWe 👏 Vote 👏 For 👏 President 👏 In 👏 November 👏 General 👏 Election\n\nAny other Democrat is free to get on the ballot if they want to be on it and can secure the requirements to do so without being elected in a primary. You can also write in whomever you want. Don't like Kamala? Write in Joe Biden. Or whoever else, idgaf. But that's how it actually works according to our actual laws.\n\nIs giving people input into their party's nominee good? Debateable. On one hand, depriving voters of a choice is a great way to cause bad feelings (see 1968 convention as an example).\n\nOn the other hand, since only the crazies show up to primaries, only the crazies get nominated. See Donald Trump as an example. Then you're stuck voting for them in the General Election.\n\nIn my opinion, the parties should be willing to defer to tell the winner of a nominee to pound sand if they're absolutely dogshit. Mark Robinson is another great example.

1969 Ford F100 (Flooded in Hurricane Helene),"My BIL had a 1969 Ford F100 flatbed that was completely submerged during Helene. Before the flood she was the kind of truck that turned heads and drew middle aged and older men to start conversations.

She was completely submerged. Mud in the carburetor, water in the cylinders, essentially worst possible scenario that doesn’t involve the truck getting washed away.

I’m thinking of buying it from him. Something in this truck is screaming at me that she’s still alive under all the mud. 

How stupid am I? I’m not a mechanic, but I’ve done some very basic wrenching when I was in the army and I’m detail oriented. These trucks seem simple enough that I can chase down the big issues and repair/replace parts as necessary. 

It’s got a 302 with a Holley carb, Edelbrock valve covers, thrush exhaust, and I know for a fact that it ran decent before the flood. I’ve driven it more than once. 

I know it’s a bit of a gamble, but I’m not looking to profit—I want the knowledge that I brought her back and I want to look cool as hell cruising this thing around.

What A Day: Dread Even by Matt Berg & Crooked Media (10/25/24),"*""We're like a garbage can for the world."" — Donald Trump [comparing immigrants to trash](https://x.com/Acyn/status/1849567685623021669).*                          
                 
**What A Pollercoaster!**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Is the race for president really as close as it seems?** It damn sure is, according to Kamala Harris’s own longtime pollster. What’s more, he cautions: Don’t be fooled into believing Donald Trump is gaining steam.                          
                 
- Anyone dialed into a group chat with anxious Democrats right now could be forgiven for thinking that former President Donald Trump has somehow broken the logjam of this campaign, and is now Godzilla-stomping his way through the swing states to another presidential term. The race for president, in fact, remains a toss-up, according to a guy with access to better private polling than the rest of us normies have ever seen. That would be Vice President Kamala Harris’ own pollster, David Binder, speaking in a rare, exclusive interview for a special episode of [*Pod Save America*](https://crooked.com/podcast-series/pod-save-america/) that will air this Sunday.                          
                 
- “We do not see momentum for Mr. Trump,” Binder told Crooked’s polling guru Dan Pfeiffer, who also hosts the [*Pollercoaster* podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/pollercoaster/id1745188174). “Not totally sure where the momentum stories are coming from … when you look at the Electoral College, the seven states that are in play, the battleground states, all of them are still within the margin of error. And you might see a point moving toward Trump in some states, and a point moving toward Harris in some states — I don't see any sign of a late break at this point.”                          
                 
- Who are the truly undecided voters left in this incredibly tight, coin-toss election? They’re people torn between rose-tinted memories of the Trump-era economy, and concerns about his extraordinary character flaws, according to Binder. “They're telling us that they're conflicted,” Binder says, between their hopes for an economic boost, and their fears about Trump’s angry, divisive, hateful, mad king routine.                          
                 
**Should Harris emphasize her own plans for the future, or the perils of a second Trump term?** The answer is both, according to Binder. Trump’s own former aides are some of the best surrogates for the latter message.                          
                 
- People who actually worked under Trump are increasingly coming out of the woodwork to warn about his authoritarian instincts as the election draws near. More than a dozen former top aides [signed a letter](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/25/never-trump-former-officials-back-kelly-warning-00185435) released today in support of former Chief of Staff John Kelly, who warned earlier this week that Trump meets the definition of a fascist and will try to govern like a dictator. “There are moments in history where it becomes necessary to put country over party. This is one of those moments,” they wrote. Former Republican Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger are effective GOP messengers, Binder said. Those who have deserted Trump’s camp may help sway undecided voters in the final days.                          
                 
- “On the stump, the former Trump staff that have now come out for her” are vitally important messengers, Binder said. They are “people that were within the White House administration that were working for Trump, wanted his administration to succeed.”                          
                 
- MAGAworld has a long-standing tendency to generate defectors who come to realize that their leader is cuckoo bananas, and dangerous too. However, the past week has signaled a new era in American politics, in which former high-ranking officials are using the word “fascist” about their old boss.                          
                 
**The question now becomes, with less than two weeks to go before Election Day, whether that message, or anything else, can break the deadlock in this race.**

**A Game Of Cat And Musk**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Billionaire conspiracy theorist Elon Musk has a message for the Justice Department: Catch me if you can!**                          
                 
**Musk has emerged as Donald Trump’s hype man from hell over the past few months, recently launching a $1 million daily sweepstakes for any registered voter from a swing state who signs a petition tied to his pro-Trump super PAC.** This week, the Department of Justice warned Musk that the giveaway might violate federal law. After that, Musk skipped a beat, and didn’t give out a big fat check on Wednesday. There was a glimmer of hope that he would sit down and shut up.                          
                 
**So much for that.** Musk [awarded two $1 million prizes](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/25/politics/elon-musk-super-pac-winners-doj-warning) late on Thursday, effectively telling the DOJ to go kick rocks.                          
                 
**Musk’s refusal to back down sets up a game of chicken between the world’s richest man and American federal law enforcement.** It's unclear what what the DOJ might do next about Musk’s unorthodox political spending spree, with the election less than two weeks away. Plenty of campaign law experts and Democrats have declared themselves aghast at the multi-million dollar giveaway direct to voters.                          
                 
**“Can you imagine how the MAGA right would respond if George Soros said he was going to give a million dollars away to everybody who's registered to vote by the end of this week?” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD), the top Democrat on the House Oversight committee, told *What A Day* earlier this week.** “It's clearly creating a financial inducement to registration from a particular partisan or ideological perspective.”

Success story! Officially part of the family ❤️,"Last month, the cutest little stray puppy wandered into my yard. There was absolutely NO WAY I was going to let him starve and be scared. 

I brought him water and food 2 times a day and he slowly started trusting me after about a week. At this point there was still absolutely no way he was going to let you touch him, or even walk past him. It was so sad, but we knew we had to take things slow and at his pace. 

Well… Hurricane Helene blew through NC and I knew I had to do something to help this guy, so I let him come into my fence. He got VERY comfortable, VERY quickly (haha). 

After asking for advice here on how to keep him warm on cold nights, my husband and I decided that we were going to keep him. (This was a week or two ago btw). 

This little guy went from being TERRIFIED of everyone and everything, to going up to people to ask for rubs and pets. He now has a collar, and harness (not quite adjusted to the harness yet, but we’re getting there 😊). He has zero reaction to my yippy dachshund and yorkie, and plays with them through the door. He has started to come into our laundry room to eat his breakfast and dinner, and loves to lay on his new doggy bed. Him and my other dogs are separated by a baby gate, but they reallllly want to meet each other lol. The slow introduction from through the glass door and then through the baby gate has been so good for all three of them! Nice and slow for everyone lol. 

Long story short, he’s going to the vet today to get all his shots and tests done to make sure he can finally meet the girls (my other dogs) face to face. I’m really proud of him for being so brave and letting us love him- but I’m also really proud of us for the major change in his personality that we helped create. This is the first time I’ve ever rescued a stray, and it has been so worth it already! 

For the second time in this group, say Hello to Bandit!

My 2016GT had flood water 6+ inches over the roof from Hurricane Helene (I’m in W North Carolina). It's been airing out for a few weeks (thankfully we haven't had rain since the hurricane). My uncle and I are going to try to get it running again, but with these newer models there's so many electronics. Once the vehicle realized it was flooding, the flashers came on and the windows automatically rolled down....I'm afraid that this turned all the electronics on and now they're fried. Does anyone know if the ND models might have a safety breaker switch that cuts power to ECU if it goes into flood mode? I can't find anything online about it.

Enjoy the pictures and wish us luck!

Edit: I bought this car right before being laid off to COVID in 2020. I got it with 30,000 miles and now it’s around 110,000.

Mold on/in Justin boots. Please help.,"These are my favorite pair of Boots that were a gift from a loved one, so they're very special to me.  They're Justin brand, and waterproof. 

Unfortunately, during hurricane Helene, they were absolutely water logged as I was still outside during the bad rain and I couldn't dry them after. 

They have white and black fuzzy mold on them inside and out and smell just awful. I really want to get back to them as my daily boots. I plan to clean them with vinegar for the mold, but am unsure of the best way to do so. 

1.)Please give me a run down of exactly what I have to do and how often I need to soak/spray a vinegar solution on and in them. 
2.)can I follow up with a laundry soap scrub and soa, then properly dry them, to get the mold and vinegar smell out of them later?
3.) how do I protect the leather after the fact? I have some saddle oil in my house. Will that protect them after the cleaning.  (They're already beat up boots, but I don't want them splitting or cracking any more than what's already around the ball of the feet.)

Advice needed regarding boundaries after Hurricane Helene,"Title says it all. I live in Western NC and was affected by Hurricane Helene. After a few days stranded in our neighborhood due to flooding, because we had no access to water, electricity, cell service or food, my husband and I decided it was important to get our two year old daughter to a more stable location and made the long drive to stay with my parents. My husband ended up having to drive back, because his job is in rainwater harvesting/management, so you can imagine he has been very busy. I work remotely, so I am very fortunate to be able to stay with my parents, while continuing to work and care for my daughter with their help.

I was hoping to keep the news about baby #2 a secret but quickly realized that living within such close proximity to my mother would make it challenging to hide, because she tends to hurt my feelings regarding what I choose to eat, that I should workout more often, what I choose to wear, etc. I thought having her know would help her be more mindful of the things she says to me, but it is almost like she has doubled down and now just monitors everything I do, saying that it is important to stay at a healthy weight for this pregnancy as to not be at risk for complications like gestational diabetes, etc. (last pregnancy I couldn't be very active as I was on crutches the majority of my pregnancy due to pubic symphysis dysfunction and I never lost all the baby weight, because life...).

  
I am wondering how you would navigate this situation, as I am so grateful to have a landing spot while our life has been turned upside down, but also need to protect my mental health and can only take so much commentary and unsolicited advice (and yes I have a therapist, just wanted to hear from other mamas who may understand the challenges that come with meddling mothers who mean well).",https://www.reddit.com/r/June2025Bumps/comments/1gcbkhf/advice_needed_regarding_boundaries_after/,1729911287.0,InevitableZucchini11,June2025Bumps,"[{'Comment Author': 'cantstopshantstop', 'Comment Body': 'Ooof, so sorry.

Hurricane Helene Damage,"Some minor damages occurred at my primary residence during Hurricane Helene… fence, shed gone, roof and chimney damage, water main busted from tree fall in front yard.

Contractor for an Insurance Estimate - ASAP?,"Hi Louisville!

I’m seeking recommendations for a quality contractor to assess and estimate the costs for repairs in my condo, which was affected by water damage from Hurricane Helene.

My condo is located in an 8-story industrial loft building downtown, and I anticipate needing the following work done:

* Window replacements
* Masonry repairs
* Painting and sealing
* Cleaning and fixing an epoxy floor
* Electrical

Straight Talk Home Internet Review,"I recently faced internet issues due to Hurricane Helene, which left my Spectrum service out of commission. After power was restored, I found myself without internet and uncertain about when it would be back. Thankfully, after searching for alternatives, I discovered Straight Talk Home Internet.

I checked several Walmart locations and eventually drove an hour to find one that had it in stock. The installation was incredibly straightforward, and within minutes, I was back online—much easier than my previous experiences with one of the major cellular internet providers.

Now, three weeks in, I can’t praise the service enough! My speeds have been consistently impressive at 195-200 Mbps down and 15-20 Mbps up. For the price, it’s an unbeatable deal! I’m seriously considering canceling my Spectrum service entirely. Highly recommend Straight Talk Home Internet!

I have had a great experience with the service, so far. If you want to try it or if you've recently signed up, enter this code to get  reward points for a FREE MONTH of service! Even if you've alraedy signed up, as long as you've signed up within the last 14 days the code will still work.

And, honestly, use the code if you want, or don't. It doesnt matter to me.

The code is:

"Going for the Dream, Fresh Fruit Year-Round","I’m trying to get more variety in my orchard to have fruit for most of the year in central Alabama zone 8A/8B. I would love to hear your recommendations for what fills in my fresh fruit gaps or what has a long shelf-life to bridge the gaps without needing to do canning, preserves, jellies, or drinks. What my family doesn’t use, I’d like to donate to the local school or to food banks (if the wildlife gives me a fair shot at a good harvest lol)

I have heavy clay soil that I’m slowly improving with mulch, compost, and gypsum. My property is hilly, and I can plant things in full sun, partial sun, or complete shade. I can grow trees in the ground, in my greenhouse (cheapo plastic tarp kind), or get grow lights for the basement. The coldest it usually gets in any year is around 12 degrees Fahrenheit for a few days in January or February. Humidity is up there and summers are high 90s and low 100s. 

For my fruit bearing plants, I currently have: 
1. Granny Smith and Golden Delicious Apple
2. Morris and Ozark Premier Plum
3. Kieffer Pear
4. Red Haven and Belle of Georgia Peach Tree
5. Dwarf Cavendish Bananas
6. Key Lime and Persian Lime
7. Improved Meyer Lemon
8. Kishu Mandarin 
9. Jersey Blueberry
10. Himrod, Mars, and Reliance Grape
11. Celeste Fig (recovering from rust during Hurricane Helene)

Thank you for any recommendations! I’m sure the squirrels, deer, and birds are eagerly awaiting what buffet options you think would be good, lol.

[FL] Wedding cancelled due to hurricane. Venue is ghosting us on refunding our deposit. Details on our contract below. ,"Our wedding was supposed to be on 10/5. However, Hurricane Helene caused major damage to the venue and the wedding could not take place. 

We found this out on Friday 9/27. They gave us the option of trying to move the wedding to one of their sister hotels or cancelling with a 100% refund. 

We opted to cancel with the refund. Since then, we have been unable to get any kind of update on getting our money back. The Venue Coordinator has said she keeps trying to press the Accounting team, but still no update or ETA. We cannot call because the hotel still doesn’t have power. Employees are working remotely. 

We are getting concerned they are trying to keep our money. 

Below is the entirety of the Force Majeure clause of our contract: 

>Meeting Confirmation may be terminated for cause without liability to the terminating party in the event of acts of God, war in th Continental U.S., government regulation, acts of terrorism within the Continental U.S., disaster, civil disorder, curtailment of transportation facilities making it impossible or illegal to perform, provided written notification is provided within five (5) busines days of such event. It is understood that if [Resort] is unable to perform under this Agreement for any reason stated in this Section, any monies paid by or its attendees to [Resort] shall be immediately refunded.

We are a little uncertain what this means. Can anyone provide guidance? It should be noted that they did immediately refund all of our guests that had reservations at the hotel for our wedding and have been completely helpful/pleasant up until this point. 

We just are struggling to get any kind of information and we are worried we are out tens of thousands of dollars.

Since they have already stated only one event was canceled, the amount of time needed to refund is negligible. The business is using your money for operating capital. As unfortunate as their need is for financial relief, your money was offered for a service not provided, not a loan, and your contract spells out the terms of the refund of your monies. There is no way to know the financial condition of the business. They could have substantial resources or they could be financed to the teeth and failure is inevitable.

"Buncombe County Helene Recovery Updates 10/25 1:20pm & 4:50pm: D-SNAP Extension, Water Restoration Updates, Early Voting This Weekend & Buncombe County Sports Park (Dog Park)","Good Evening Land of Sky Folk! I am sharing the Buncombe County official updates from today for those who are not receiving their emails/texts. There was a second update sent out via text today, so I am appending the second one to the bottom of the first here. It's good news for people looking for a dog park in town.

I have tried to add some quick formatting and headers to make the updates easier to read, since they sent them mostly unformatted. Here are the full texts:

# Caution: Tunnel Road & Charlotte Highway Half-Gallons

Out of an abundance of caution, the unlabeled half-gallon bottles of water from the Tunnel Road and Charlotte Highway distribution sites featuring green lids should be used as non-potable or gray water only. 

While the water has not been found to be unsafe, there have been reports of discoloration, so water from those bottles should not be consumed. Buncombe County will work with the manufacturer and the appropriate monitoring authorities to ensure the water meets the highest levels of safety. In the meantime, this water should not be consumed. 

# D-SNAP Extension 

The USDA has extended the deadline for Buncombe County residents to apply for help buying food through the Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) to 4 p.m. Friday. Individuals and households not currently receiving Food and Nutrition Services benefits who were impacted by Hurricane Helene can apply for D-SNAP. Apply in person at Buncombe County Health and Human Services, 40 Coxe Ave., Asheville from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Friday. As of this morning, there was not a long line, so please come down and apply. 

The online application process and call center are no longer available. 

At close of business Wednesday, Buncombe County had issued 4,276 cards with a total benefit amount of $2,553,456. Additionally, Buncombe County issued 370 cards for customers approved through the state’s call center process. We also have about 6,000 people who we will be following up with who started that registration process through epass. 

This extension is only for residents in Alexander, Buncombe, Haywood, Macon and McDowell Counties only. 

# Spectrum Updates 

Spectrum has restored service to nearly 93% of customers in Buncombe County with just over 7,000 customers remaining offline as of Oct. 23. 

Restoration is taking longer than they initially anticipated due to the amount of damage and repairs required, challenges to safely access certain areas, and the need to return to make repairs in areas where infrastructure is being rebuilt. They are facing specifically challenging rebuild conditions in a number of areas including the Biltmore Forest where in addition to miles of network repairs, they need to rebuild one of the nodes that delivers services to the area. In the Black Mountain area along the Swannanoa River, they are working to repair a major fiber artery for the network. Similar work is being done on our network on the east side of Weaverville. Our crews continue to work through challenges in these and other areas and are looking to restore services as quickly as possible. 

Once service has been restored, customers will automatically receive a credit for the time they were without service. 

As of this morning 34 Duke Energy customers remain without power. Crews also have been tasked with cleanup, identifying and removing all remaining Duke Energy debris including broken poles, power lines, and transformers that weren’t removed during the initial restoration process.

# Water Restoration Update 

Turbidity at North Fork Reservoir: Treatment at the North Fork Reservoir to manage high sediment levels is ongoing. As of lyesterday, the level was 25. Under normal conditions the turbidity levels is under 1. 

North Fork Auxiliary Spillway: The auxiliary spillway is dry under normal conditions. The reservoir at North Fork was 8 feet below normal before Hurricane Helene, but reached full status on the night of Thursday, Sept. 26, rising 8 feet in 12-14 hours. The level indicators top out at 10 feet above full pool, and the lake reached that point the morning of Sept. 27, meaning it rose an additional 10 feet in 12 hours. It stayed at this level just before noon on Sept. 27. Staff were not able to get an exact reading because the indicator had topped out and it was too dangerous to access. The lake rose at least 18 feet during the storm. The auxiliary spillway activates at approximately 7 ½ feet above full pool, with buckets filling up and mechanically tipping as they are designed to do. The excess rain that landed in the watershed and reservoir naturally flowed out of the emergency spillway by mechanical activation. It is possible that water from one or both of the spillways at North Fork washed out the main transmission lines. 

The dams have been inspected by engineers for the third time yesterday, and while there are repairs needed, they are safe. 

# Buncombe County Solid Waste 

Today, household bagged trash drop-offs can be made at the North Buncombe Pool until 3:30 p.m. 

Debris collection is continuing in Fairview, Swannanoa, and North Buncombe. Set out storm debris at the right of way separated it into large appliances, vegetative debris, hazardous waste, construction debris, and electronics. Trucks will make several passes. 

Don’t forget that if you are a Waste Pro customer, you will need to sign up for service with FCC Environmental to continue household trash and recycling pick-up after Jan. 1. Go to [www.buncombecounty.org/solidwaste](http://www.buncombecounty.org/solidwaste) for more information. We know this is really tough to add one more thing as we’re going through our disaster recovery response, but please go ahead and get signed up so they can be sure to serve you in the new year. 

# City of Asheville 

ART Transit Services: Starting this Sunday, October 27, ART will resume regular scheduled hours for most bus routes. The schedule is 5:30 a.m. to 11 p.m., Monday through Saturday, and 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sundays and holidays. Buses are no longer offering flag stops. Transit riders need to wait at a designated bus stop to board their bus. 

ART service will continue to be free of charge to all community members until further notice. Also, Shuttle service is still providing transportation between the WNC Agriculture Center and American Red Cross shelters. 

Please visit [ashevillenc.gov/transit](http://ashevillenc.gov/transit) for more information. 

Afterschool programs resume from 3-6 p.m. starting Monday, October 28. Currently the City is only able to offer after school program opportunities to students who were previously enrolled. For more information about these events and additional programming, please visit [ashevillenc.gov/parks](http://ashevillenc.gov/parks). 

Storm Debris: A contractor with experience in natural disaster debris removal and work has begun to get this debris out of neighborhoods and business districts. Temporary storm debris sites are necessary to process and ultimately remove debris from our community. The City continues to pursue temporary debris sites in all geographic areas. 

While sanitation crews will begin collecting paper bagged leaves starting on Monday, October 28, the City asks to consider waiting as long as you can to set out bags of leaves for collection to help crews move as efficiently as they can through the ongoing storm debris removal process. 

The next community briefing will be on Monday at 11 a.m. and can be viewed at [www.facebook.com/buncombegov](http://www.facebook.com/buncombegov)

# Second update starts here

Smoking Weed 24/7,"We’ve had an ongoing feud with our downstairs neighbors. For context, we moved in in September 2023 and they moved in in July 2024. We had a letter on our door complaining about vacuuming at night, so we stopped. Then one night I was putting dishes away and they came to our door to complain about our noise that day. We started strictly using slippers and added pads to the bottom of our chairs to minimize noises. I stopped vacuuming after 9 pm- I do  it a lot because we have cats and litter gets everywhere. Anyways, on a Sunday at 4 pm, I was mopping with the tineco vacuum/mop and heard a large bang from below- indicating I should stop but it was literally 4 pm. Anyways, I just continued bc at this point they just want us to stop existing. Anyways, we live in FL and lost electricity during hurricane Helene so our complex was so quiet you can hear a pin drop. We were cleaning up a late dinner at like 10 pm and the started to bang on their ceiling so hard our glass began to rattle and our cats jumped. I had it at this point so I stomped back and got on my phone and wrote an email to management to which they responded saying we were receiving a violation for noise, saying we vacuum late at night every day so clearly our downstairs neighbors lied bc we had made conscious efforts to stop. I spoke to management and they said this is routine and it’s not a huge deal but I disagreed.

So that’s the backstory. Fast forward to today, I am so uncomfortable in my home. Considering the weather is nice, we love to open our balcony doors. But now.. it’s unbearable bc of the heavy smoke stench that creeps from their apartment to ours. I’ve already complained about them and don’t know what to do. It’s only when the balcony door is open so I want to know if there are tips and tricks for the smoke to go outwards instead of in. I wake up around 6 for work and open the door for the cats to enjoy the quiet and dark morning. My husband woke up around 8 and said he woke up to the smell of weed in our apartment. They were up smoking so early and do it constantly throughout the day. I honestly don’t know what to do and since I’m pregnant, I’m extra sensitive to the smells. I want to enjoy the weather and live openly and freely but I’m having a really tough time with them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Apartmentliving/comments/1gc8e1j/smoking_weed_247/,1729900766.0,Inside-Quantity-9218,Apartmentliving,"[{'Comment Author': 'WorldOfRoses', 'Comment Body': 'Just curious: Why did you think vacuuming after 9pm was appropriate in an apt?'}, {'Comment Author': 'Fickle-Addendum9576', 'Comment Body': 'Having a fan blow out the door will push the smoke away.

I bought a large oscillating pedestal fan, with a remote. I put it outside on my patio. I also have a high-quality air purifier in the kitchen, by the sliding glass doors. Whenever I smell the smoke, I use the remote and put the fan on, so I don’t have to open the door and let more smoke in. And then I turn the air purifier on high. Fortunately, they are pretty routine about the times when they smoke, so I can use the timer feature on the fan.

AP is accusing WP of coercion and harassment? ,"The AP is my roommate and formerly one of my best friends.  
I could see there was a mutual attraction there for the last two years. My roommate would get downright \*weird\* when my WP would come over. The dynamic would shift so much. She would start to bully me and tried to get my WP to join her. My WP eventually cut contact with my roommate, and I thought maybe I was just being crazy.  
Hurricane Helene hit, and Asheville (where me and the roommate live) was inaccessible. The radio kept saying ""Asheville is an island."" My roommate was out of town, and she couldnt get home. She ended up staying with my WP.

I don't think anyone has ever really made a pass at my roommate. I think this might've been her first kiss, at 32. Shes saying she was coerced, that my WP kept coming on to her and she ""didnt know how to pull away."" Eventually her sister chimes in saying my WP molested the roommate, and that consent was never actually given.

They hugged, cuddled, kissed, over the course of five days. My roommate stayed with my WP instead of going to another friends house who lived down the street and had a spare room open and invited. Then they rode together back to Asheville when a route opened up, instead of my roommate getting another rental car and driving herself. And then when they got home, my roommate took me aside and told me, very reassuringly, that my WP was doing okay dealing with the storm.

Most of me doesn't believe my roommate. I think she's skirting responsibility. But then, a part of me wonders. I cant not wonder about a claim like this. If she actually didnt give her consent, I could never reconcile with the AP. But if shes being dishonest, I cant reconcile with the roommate. Im so angry and I dont even know where to point the anger anymore.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity/comments/1gc7i7i/ap_is_accusing_wp_of_coercion_and_harassment/,1729898099.0,Thin-Associate-6272,AsOneAfterInfidelity,"[{'Comment Author': 'AutoModerator', 'Comment Body': ""r/Asoneafterinfidelity is an online Peer Support Group and safe space for individuals (betrayed or wayward) who are actively attempting to reconcile their relationship after an affair(s).

Helping FEMA meet temporary housing needs ,"This morning it was pointed out that a few topics from Buncombe County's 10/24 recovery update should be separately posted to emphasize them. FEMA is currently seeking interested, qualified owners or property management companies to help meet the temporary housing needs for Hurricane Helene survivors by leasing their properties directly to FEMA. Getting families out of shelters and hotels and into longer-term solutions is a priority and FEMA’s Direct Lease & Multifamily Lease and Repair Programs help families find more stable housing while they continue their recovery. 

Beyond that little bit above, the update only gave incomplete or insufficient information, so I found a post in the Newsroom section of FEMA's website on the subject. The post has information for disaster victims in need of longer-term temporary housing beyond short-term solutions like hotel rooms. It also has information for property owners or management companies interested in working with FEMA to aid disaster victims while simultaneously serving their own interests. It's worth noting that the post mentions FEMA funding property repairs and/or improvements, which may be particularly beneficial for property owners interested in working with them. Here is a link to the post: [https://www.fema.gov/fact-sheet/direct-temporary-housing-assistance-helene-survivors](https://www.fema.gov/fact-sheet/direct-temporary-housing-assistance-helene-survivors)

Here are some important points from the post:

* FEMA is soliciting interest in Direct Lease and Multifamily Lease and Repair (MLR). FEMA posted requests for Information on [SAM.GOV](http://SAM.GOV) on October 7, 2024 for [Direct Lease](https://sam.gov/opp/4259c909ba234fb68e23f8f8bf4c8a73/view) and [MLR](https://sam.gov/opp/952287f07e2d40aeb90aeaaf473f87b5/view). Interested property owners or management companies must provide responses and comments no later than 5:00 PM EST, Nov. 6, 2024 via email to [fema-mlr\_dr4827nc@fema.dhs.gov](mailto:fema-mlr_dr4827nc@fema.dhs.gov) and [fema direct\_lease\_dr4827nc@fema.dhs.gov](mailto:fema%20direct_lease_dr4827nc@fema.dhs.gov). The email subject line should read: RFI #70FBR425-MLR-DR4827NC Response: MLR-DR-4827-NC
* Aid applicants do not need to apply separately for Direct Temporary Housing Assistance. After receiving an application for FEMA assistance and completing a home assessment, FEMA contacts households that may qualify to determine whether the applicant needs direct temporary housing and, if so, which type of housing.
* Not all applicants will qualify for DTHA. Applicants who do not qualify may qualify for rental assistance.

> A Maryland Republican who leads a right-wing coalition in Congress says North Carolina&#039;s legislature should consider awarding Electoral College votes to former President Donald Trump before citizens&#039; votes are counted, according to Politico.

> North Carolina&#039;s State Board of Elections voted unanimously across party lines earlier this month to approve emergency measures to make it easier for victims of Hurricane Helene in 13 counties to vote.

> North Carolina is a battleground state with 16 electoral votes that could decide the presidential election.

> Levitt said in order for a state legislature to award electoral votes in lieu of the voters, that legislature would have to pass a law and have the governor sign it.

> Then the secretary of state notifies the governor which party&#039;s electors, Republican or Democrat, have been chosen by the voters.

> Then the secretary of state will convene the Electoral College to cast votes on Dec. 17 so that the new Congress can meet Jan. 6 to count every state&#039;s electoral votes.

What is my neighbor's liability here?,"4 trees fell from my neighbors yard onto my house during hurricane Helene.

Now that the trees are damaged, by having already partially fallen, is it not his responsibility to remedy this?  If something gives way, the stuff that's still there will crush my house.

"Given any opportunity, MAGA will take away your vote.","Given any opportunity, MAGA will take away your vote.

As reported, the right-wing's MAGA controlled legislature is still considering ways and methods to set aside election results and just award all of North Carolina's electoral votes to Trump. This is the kind of country they are laying the groundwork for. They advocate for a country where, as Trump promised, the Constitution would be invalidated and governance would be controlled by a cadre of insolent and arrogant seditionists, with no input by the voters of the nation.

In their conceit and hubris, they consider themselves to be above you -- all knowing and paternalistic -- and in their authoritarian fever-dream see themselves on high while the underclass, the untouchables, grovel for scraps.

This is the face of fascism, and they make no attempt at hiding it.

Vote now, while you can. Else, the day will come when the niceties disappear, and all decisions will be made by a chosen few.

It happened in Germany, it happened in China, it happened in North Korea, and preparations are now in full swing for it to happen here in North Carolina, and then throughout the nation.

Our only hope is to vote the tyrants out while we can. The must be defeated by an overwhelming margin and then prosecuted for their criminal insurgence so they will never attempt this scheme again.

See this report -- boldface mine.



""Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., chair of the **right-wing House Freedom Caucus**, suggested North Carolina’s **GOP-controlled legislature should declare former President Donald Trump the winner** of the state’s 16 electors **before votes are finalized,** giving credence to the far-flung scheme that drew bipartisan rebuke on Capitol Hill. Harris said Thursday during a Republican Party dinner in Talbot County, Maryland, that it “**makes a lot of sense”** to convene the legislature early to **certify electoral votes for Trump before they’re finalized,** considering that Hurricane Helene may have disenfranchised voters in some counties ravaged by the storm, many of which are heavily Republican.

Harris was responding to a suggestion from pro-Trump activist Ivan Raiklin advocating for North Carolina and other states to certify their election results before they’re finalized “so that those states guarantee that no illegals are voting, no illegal drop boxes, no illegal signature non verifications going on,” he said during the Thursday meeting, according to a video of the remarks he posted to his X account. Harris suggested **the plan was “legitimate” in North Carolina,** given the devastation from Helene, but questioned whether it would work in other states.

Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., chair of the House Administration committee tasked with overseeing election processes, blasted the plan as a “**blood-chilling scheme,”** in a statement to Politico, adding **“extreme Republican leaders are openly advocating that North Carolina’s electoral votes be given to Donald Trump without an election.”** Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., told reporters Friday he hadn’t heard about the plans discussed in Talbot County but that “it makes no sense whatsoever to prejudge the election outcome. And that is a misinformed view of what is happening on the ground in North Carolina, bless his heart.”

16. That’s how many electoral votes belong to North Carolina, one of the seven swing states that will decide the election. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are locked in a dead heat there, with Five Thirty Eight’s polling average showing Trump leading by 1.3 points.

**Trump and his allies appear to be gearing up to contest the results of the 2024 election if Trump loses.** While Trump has said he hasn’t seen any signs of fraud so far in the election process and has encouraged his supporters to vote early, he has also said Harris can’t win unless Democrats cheat. **Republicans have already filed a slew of election-related legal challenges this cycle.**

"More than 1,000 commercial vehicles have attempted to use U.S. 441/Newfound Gap Road since Hurricane Helen","From the National Park:

""With many major driving routes near Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP) impacted by Hurricane Helene, the national park is still seeing an influx in commercial vehicles trying to navigate its steep, curvy roads. Commercial vehicles are prohibited on US 441/Newfound Gap Road and in all of GSMNP for everyone’s safety.

""Since the storm, the park has turned around over 1,000 commercial vehicles trying to enter the park and responded to multiple incidents involving large commercial trucks. Violators will be subject to a citation as well as a fine of up to $5,000. Highway 441/Newfound Gap Road is a two-lane road with steep, continuous grades and tight curves. There are no truck lanes, runaway truck ramps or places for a large commercial vehicle to slow down and pull over.

small business help,My wife and I own a small restaurant in WNC and we got flooded by hurricane helene. We had a wedding scheduled to take place but of course it was cancelled. The mother had already made significant changes to the menu. It says on the invoice that no changes may be made after a certain date. She wanted her money back after the flood and we told her we would give her 1/2 back. We sent her a certified check in the mail which unfortunately she has not cashed. She is hell bent on taking us to civil court over around $600. That's why I cannot get a lawyer for this. It would not be worth it. Any advise? Can she win this case? Thanks much!,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1gc1o44/small_business_help/,1729882227.0,immafartonu,legaladvice,"[{'Comment Author': 'Rural_Jurist', 'Comment Body': 'What do the terms of your services agreement or quote say on the matter? Does the agreement/quote include a ""force majeure"" clause or ""no refunds"" policy?\n\nIf the mother sues, it will likely be in small claims court, so you and she don\'t need attorneys. (In the amount you\'re talking about, it\'s highly unlikely any lawyer would take her case to big kids court.)\n\nNo one can guess if she would win or lose. From what you\'ve described, mother and your business had an agreement that your business would provide dining/catering services for $X amount of money. The hurricane flooded your business and you couldn\'t provide the services. Primarily, you have a business decision to make: you can refund the total she\'s asking, or see what happens.\n\nIf your position is to only refund half, a (possible) court will want to know your reasons behind that decision.'}]"
Would you drink this water?,I rent our home in the southern appalachian region and I tested our water after hurricane Helene. I am guessing my landlord will be annoyed I had it tested because he says they have been drinking the stream fed well water for years and never had any issues. Here are the results from the water samples I sent to the lab. These are from water that have already gone through a 10 micron string filter. I have a baby and I was worried so we have only been drinking bottled water while I waited for these test results.

Since you do not have any E. coli in your system, then it is very likely that the contamination is coming from a broken pipe where total coliforms from the soil can intrude into the water system.

If this doesn't work, then they need to somehow add chlorine to the water supply and then strip it out with a whole house charcoal filter.

I would recommend also making a record with the city. Here in nyc, we have 311 to call to make complaints against landlords in regards to housing issues like no hot water, no water at all, no heat mold, etc.\n\nAlso as another poster said there maybe a broken sewer pipe leeching bacteria into your water supply. If you have a septic system your landlord should have it inspected to you should also request information on the last time it was pumped out. Ussally it's done every 1 to 2 years from what I understand but I'm not a professional.  I do know that septic system not maintained will cause issues with the leech fields if it's that sort of system.  Only so much is supposed to come out into the leech fields but if the system hasn't been pumped all your sewage is going right into the ground then which might be the cause.

Shower Filters after Hurricane Helene,"Hi, I wasn’t sure where to ask for advice about this but I figured if anyone would be knowledgeable it would be plumbers! 

I live in Asheville, NC. Due to Hurricane Helene, our water systems were dealt a heavy blow and, while they’ve got water back running, it isn’t really usable for anything other than flushing for many homes. It’s a yellow-brown and it smells fruity and chemical-ly, kind of like someone put a grape kool-aid packet into a bucket of bleach or chlorine. I have to use lotion every time I put my hands in it. 

TL;DR: City water got messed up by hurricane, photo attached of what is coming through our taps. It’s good to flush but not really anything else. Is there a shower filter that anyone could recommend so we can at least take a shower at home? ",https://i.redd.it/rvrvil4q4ywd1.jpeg,1729881128.0,Soggy_Associate2916,Plumbing,[]
Florida Unemployment Site- First time trying to log in as an employer,"I'm an employer who had to temporarily lay off my staff due to hurricane Helene.

I've tried everything, including calling the employer assistance number multiple times a day, every day (no one answers and the automated system hangs up on me). I requested a password reset from the online RA Help Center about 5 times, and finally received an email stating they could not verify my ownership of the business, and to try again or call the number (the one I've been calling and getting nowhere with).

"Deadline for D-SNAP extended to Oct. 25 in some WNC counties (Alexander, Buncombe, Haywood, Macon and McDowell)","The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services has just announced a one-day extension for residents of Alexander, Buncombe, Haywood, Macon and McDowell counties to apply for benefits through the D-SNAP program to help them purchase food.

Residents in those five counties now have until Friday, Oct. 25 from 8 a.m.-4 p.m., to apply in person for D-SNAP benefits. Any person who is in line by 4 p.m. on Friday will be able to complete their application and interview.

According to NCDHHS, the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved the extension after feedback from the counties requested an extension for in-person applications.

As of Wednesday, Oct. 23, more than 105,000 individuals had been approved to receive D-SNAP benefits, NCDHHS reports.

The deadline to apply for the Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or D-SNAP, in all other counties is still Oct. 24.

D-SNAP is a program through the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services intended for people with storm-related losses.

If approved, applicants can receive a one-time benefit to help them buy food.

There are specific requirements applicants must meet to be approved for program eligibility.

These requirements are listed below:

Have suffered losses/damages related to Hurricane Helene, such as damage to property or loss of income
Have proof of identity and proof of residency (if available)
Not currently receiving benefits through Food and Nutrition Services (FNS). People receiving FNS can also get extra help to buy food but do not need to fill out a D-SNAP application.
Certain income and resource limits may apply.

What A Day: Up Pill Battle by Matt Berg & Crooked Media (10/24/24),"*""I stopped wars with France."" — Donald Trump [explaining what he did](https://x.com/atrupar/status/1849245123000910289) in the White House during to a Turning Point USA event.*                          
                 
**(Birth) Control Freaks**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Donald Trump keeps saying he won’t enact a national abortion ban if elected.** But there are plenty of other ways he and Republicans could curtail reproductive rights if they win.                          
                 
- Former President Donald Trump has flipped his position on abortion so often, you’d think it was a cell phone from 1999. In fact, that was the year he declared himself “very pro choice,” two decades before trashing abortion protections in America by appointing Supreme Court justices who repealed *Roe v. Wade*. Lately, he’s saying he’ll leave the decision to the states, while absurdly referring to himself as “father of IVF” (a claim that hardly passes the laugh test). His inconsistency, to the point of incoherence, shows that nothing he says on this issue can be trusted. Pro-choice advocates widely believe that he’d fall in line with the far-right Project 2025 agenda, which outlines ways to [aggressively restrict abortion](https://www.vox.com/politics/373485/project-2025-abortion-ban-trump-comstock-mifepristone). But, here’s the thing: Even if he kept his word about not signing a national abortion ban, he and his MAGA crew would have plenty of other options for rolling back reproductive rights even further.                          
                 
- High on the list: A dusty, old, horse-and-buggy-era relic called the Comstock Act. The anti-obscenity law from 1873 theoretically prohibits mailing or receiving of stuff like pornography and abortion medication, although it’s been largely dormant for decades. (We can all agree that going back to 19th century standards of obscenity sounds like a super fun idea, I’m sure. What’s next, will right-wingers demand we all start riding around on those old-timey bicycles with one huge wheel?) Implementing this law could [restrict access](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/how-the-comstock-act-threatens-abortion-rights) to abortion pills, which are now involved in a majority of abortions in the U.S. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court dismissed a case in which anti-abortion advocates argued that mifepristone, a widely used abortion pill, should be outlawed under the Comstock Act — but the conservative majority has signaled that they’d be willing to hear similar cases again. Trump angered anti-abortion advocates this summer when he said the federal government “should have nothing to do with this issue.” But the Comstock Act is a key part of Project 2025, which includes scores of people who would likely staff his administration and want the law implemented.                          
                 
**Nothing says democracy like enforcing a 150-year-old law that [most Americans don’t know exists](https://navigatorresearch.org/two-in-three-support-updating-the-comstock-act-to-not-apply-to-abortion/)!** But there are other ways to target mifepristone, too.                          
                 
- The Trump administration could, in theory, deploy top health officials to target scientists at the Food and Drug Administration and override their views on abortion pills, Mary Ziegler, a professor at UC Davis Law, told *What A Day*. Mifepristone, the most common abortion pill, is [safer than Viagra and penicillin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/research-news/18556/). But that might not matter if Trump’s MAGA minions get to decide what’s safe and what isn’t. While barring access to mifepristone over spurious safety concerns or other pretexts wouldn’t equal an abortion ban, “it would still have a pretty significant national impact, because well over half of all abortions in blue and purple, as well as red states, take place involving this drug,” Ziegler said. This is especially bone-chilling, considering Trump has floated naming roadkill enthusiast Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of health and human services if elected.                          
                 
- Then, there’s the long game: The concept of “fetal personhood.” The idea that a fetus, embryo, or fertilized egg should have the same rights as a human has shifted from the fringe far-right​ to mainstream politics in recent years. It’s anti-abortion advocates’ “new North Star, meaning the thing you use to guide you, but something that's going to take you a while to actually reach,” Ziegler said. Seventeen states currently have fetal personhood on the books, according to Pregnancy Justice​, a non-profit that defends abortion rights. With a Republican president and GOP control in Congress, it would be easier to appoint federal judges who could consider fetal personhood down the line. The Supreme Court likely wouldn’t consider the measure within the next few years, Ziegler added, but Trump could start laying the groundwork for a legal challenge — like he did with *Roe v. Wade*, which was overturned during the Biden administration.                          
                 
**Donald Trump has options to attack reproductive rights if he wins, and each of them would harm everyday Americans.**

**That would be former deputy Palm Beach County Sheriff John Mark Dougan, who reportedly now resides in Moscow, after what I assume must have been a series of very interesting life choices.** Documents obtained by European intelligence services found that Dougan has been working alongside the Russian military to circulate disinfo and create deep fakes of Kamala Harris, according to veteran Moscow correspondent Catherine Belton writing for the [*Washington Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/10/23/dougan-russian-disinformation-harris/). For instance, Dougan is believed to be behind a recent fake viral video smearing​ Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), Harris’s running mate.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/AoSQdHAciB): **September 11, 2024**

I 26 (F) have been dating my current 'fiancé' Mark (27) for a little over seven years now. We are not actually engaged but claim to be because we have dated longer than what he insisted was the 'dating phase' to see if we could really stay together (4 years).

Anyways, for some time now, I would say about two years things have really taken a turn for the hills, especially since the beginning of this year. We both work and go to school full time but I am the only one who does the domestic work, takes care of our dog, etc. I work, go to school, come back home, clean, cook, get his stuff ready, walk/feed/play/train our dog; the whole nine yards. From time to time to he would 'help' if I reminded him, asked him or complained enough.

This has only begun to get worse as time has passed. I have told him for months on end that I do not feel loved, supported, appreciated, cared for, etc by him anymore. I try to give everything to him but there are a lot of times where he only wants to be on his phone, watch TV or only be half to a third 'present'. For example, he says that he will walk our dog when he gets back from work constantly, but he hasn't for months. He says that he is exhausted and tired from work and school, while saying that he understands where my frustrations are coming from but still does nothing to elevate the burden.

Our intimate life has become obsolete but he has begun to watch pornography multiple times a week even though I told him that I consider that cheating and is breaking my boundaries. He told me that he is just going through a hard time and just can't find it in him to be interested in me because it takes too much time, effort and mental energy from him. I asked if he still found me attractive and all he said was ""yeah, I can still get off but not like I used to anymore.""

I have suggested couples counseling a few months ago and even found many that can work in our schedules but he refuses to look into them or even try to go. He keeps saying that we just have to try harder together, actually communicate better and compromise a lot more than what we are now.

I was sitting on our bed a few days ago while he was having his ""escapade"" in the bathroom again and I asked if I could see myself still marrying him. My automatic answer was no. No, I couldn't because I couldn't imagine continuing to live like this. But I am grieving for not having a relationship because I feel I would have wasted all of these years on someone that I am in love with but I am not happy with anymore. I am so, so miserable, stressed and exhausted. I want to escape and cry.

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Full stop referring to him as your fiance. If there is no ring and no proposal you are his girlfriend not his fiance. He has no plans to actually marry you and is using you to make his life easier. Throw the whole man away

**Commenter 2:** I’d start taking the steps to move out and move on. A situation like this is never easy, when you’ve invested so much in the person, but you don’t want to be married to someone like that. 

**Commenter 3:** If he prefers to jerk off to porn instead of having sex with you, sorry to say this, but then you're nothing but a live-in maid to him. You take care of everything while he does nothing. Break it off, I'm pretty sure you and your dog will be better without him. You deserve love and respect, and that man certainly isn't giving it to you.

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/epSZFuUxGZ): **September 19, 2024 (eight days later)**

Update: Hello everyone. I don’t know how updates on here work but I hope I am doing this right. I’m sorry if it’s not right.

It has been about a week since I posted and during that week unfortunately I have found out that I am pregnant. My ex-boyfriend saw the tests in the trash and became enraged because he thought I was hiding it from him. I wasn’t, I was just in shocked because we both used protection. He told me that raising a child together could have saved us if I wasn’t such a ‘selfish bitch’. He then accused me of cheating because there was no way I could get pregnant by him if I am on BC. I asked if he was dumb and that is when things hit the fan. Words were said, hands were thrown and ultimately our (my) dog bit him and the police were called. We both gave statements and they made him leave the apartment.

I am lucky to have some friends in the police department that have checked on me every night since then. I also have some friends who are helping me pack and move so he can have the apartment. I am unsure of what to do with this pregnancy as I have never wanted or have interest in kids. However, I am thankful that I have friends who will support me no matter what decision I make.

I am still in shock of what happened. I have never experienced such fear from my ex-boyfriend as I did in that moment. I don’t know how or why things took such a turn for the worse but they did. I have been thinking and wondering of how I have missed the signs and flags for possibly so long. I have even more concerns about my dog. He has never bit or even try to bite someone in the seven years he has been alive but he did my ex which brings me even more worry, fear and anxiety. I have concerns that the county I live in my make me put him down because he is a pitbull mix but I am hoping with backing from my friends, the police officers of that night, the vet, etc will help me keep him.

I want to say thank you to everyone who replied. I appreciate the support, kindness and encouragement. I know it should have been an ‘obvious’ or ‘simple’ answer/thing to do but that is my own personal ignorance. Thank you.

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Dogs are protective of their pack. Your dog sees you as family and therefore attacked the threat. With the police report he more than likely will just be quarantined and given back to you. But chances are that may not even happen either. I wouldn’t worry about it at all. 

**Commenter 2:** You need to take a hard look at your current situation because if you have a child with him, he will forever remain in your life. If you think his behaviors are bad now wait until you’re carrying his child or that precious innocent one is here. The best thing for you and your situation would be to abort. Get a clean break and leave him for your past.

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/0E6Tz1NViy): **October 18, 2024 (one month later)**

It has been about a month since I have updated, and I'm not even sure if anyone even cares or remembers but I thought I would give a final update. First, I want to address somethings that have been said and mentioned since then. I'm sorry if this is long in advance.

1. I would like to address that many (I am supposing men) have come to ask me of which hands were thrown why and the possibility of me deserving it. I will say that once you get into a situation where you are verbally abused, then shoved with so much force you hit the floor and loose your breath, that you too put up the best fight that you can. However, I hope you never have to feel the helplessness and the powerlessness that goes into being pinned down, punched, scratched and more while all you can do is barley wiggle your feet and hope for a moment that he stops so you can attempt to scream for help.

2. Yes, there are details missing because I did not feel all details were necessary. I should not have to recount the times of shoves, slaps, punches and verbal insults thrown at me to justify the final outcome.

3. When you grow up with abuse, that is all you know so it is hard to register it as abuse. My mother raised me with a very heavy hand and the idea of ‘tough love’. In most cases, she would slap, punch, shove and emotional/verbally abuse me, just as he did. Growing up having a parent tell you that them hitting you hurts you more than them and that they are doing it out of love; that is all you come to know and understand as love.

4. With the many who privately messaged me about taking into consideration adoption, I ask: are you doing that with the full understanding of adoption and all the ugly, or just the biased moral ego that has been instilled? Just because people pay a lot doesn’t mean they will treat a child right or well. There are many cases where adoptees are neglected, abused, etc. Adoption in itself is heavily influenced by religious manipulation, racism, homophobia and classism. Most adoptive couples do not want open adoptions for fear of having ‘their’ child stolen or taken away by the birth parents. There are also adoptive parents who turn the adoptee against the birth parents for multiple reasons. The biggest thing I have to say: I have to destroy my whole body, mental and emotional health just to bring someone else the joy and happiness they couldn’t have in the first place? I have to carry the weight of being a birth parent that is shamed, ridiculed and bullied by outsiders for being irresponsible, a possible addict, etc while the adoptive parents are labeled as heroes/saviors? Plus, in looking at birth parent support/help, where is it? There is little to none for birth parents because they are forgotten for the sake of the adoptive parents/adoptee as their ‘job’ is done. I implore everyone who suggests adoption as a ‘solution to all’ problems when it comes to pregnancy and choices, to actually look at adoption for all of its dark sides as well. Adoption is not always sunshine and roses, we cannot forget or neglect that for biases and ideals that have been given. Please stop with the savior complex.

**Actual Update:** Things have changed in the last month. I have officially moved into my own apartment. My ex and I's last apartment ended getting destroyed during Hurricane Helene, which I felt was the way of the Universe telling me something positive.

My dog is with me officially now. He did have to go into quarantine for about a week. They behavior checked him in a lot of situations and he did great on all of them. Fortunately, since there were reports and support for him by friends, vets/vet techs, neighbors, the police, etc he did not have to be put down! However, he does have to wear a muzzle when out in public spaces around men. He has started to adjust to our new living situation but is doing much better.

My pregnancy came and went in a way. Between my ex, dealing with the courts/police, moving, situation with my dog, Hurricane Helene, mental health issues, etc I did end up miscarriaging at 11 weeks 3 days. I am thankful it went as smoothly as something like that can go, especially with what has been happening to women in the same situation. I have been trying to get my uterus taken out and my tubes tied, but since I live in such a red state/area it has been hard. They all talk about the 'what ifs' when dealing with a future husband and his wants of children. I have been feeling discouraged and mad, but I want to keep trying.

My ex has tried many times to contact me including through my mother who I do not speak with anymore. He has shown up to my job and asked when I am working, where I am, etc. I have only recently blocked him, as I have been trying to get evidence to get a restraining order on him. I have what is needed like threats, verbal abuse and destruction of property so I hope it all goes well. The police friends that I have have been really helpful and still continue to check up on me. Apparently DV cases are common in my area and they don't want me to end up as they normally see women here do.

I am in therapy and have been trying to keep a positive outlook. I wanted to thank everyone for their kindness, support, encouragement and knowledge. I cannot thank you all enough!

**Additional Information from OOP regarding adoptions**

> **OOP:** I find that interesting, are you also looking at the stats of adopted children in cases of suicide, mental illness, addiction, discrimination, etc because of adoption? 
> 
> Are you also looking at stats including transracial/ intercountry adoption? Of course there is always positives to adoption, yet there are also many negatives as well that are overlooked. How many adoptees can claim to have positive outcomes/experiences yet not realize until their older that they actually didn’t. 
> 
> Many adoptees still grow up without feeling connected, validated and even properly seen. You may say that that is life with a lot of families which is terrible in itself, now imagine feeling that as adopted child with people who you already have an internal disconnect with. Many also don’t get to tell their own stories or get to express themselves and the negative feelings that come with being adopted. 
> 
> There is also the road of birth parents who are often ostracized for giving up their child. Who do not get helped postpartum, who could never see their child again because the adoptive parents don’t want them to, etc. Yes, there are positive examples such as Simone, Jimmy Butler, Aaron Judge, etc but that doesn’t mean all are. 
> 
> We also have to take into consideration that biased, manipulative narratives and untold stories that are never spoken to ‘save’ others. I encourage you to ‘Adoption Unfiltered’ and other works by all parties: adoptees, birth parents and adoptive parents. 
> 
> We must read from all POVs, all sides and more before saying things like adoption are positive by looking at specific stats and people to fit our own narrative. Adoption like many other things, is not for everyone and is not always a true solution. We cannot act like it always is. 😊

In cases of endometriosis, taking out the uterus is not enough. The ovaries must come out so that the female cycle is gone. \n\nThis of course means instant menopause, so you need a doctor who is willing to prescribe HRT from the day of the operation.\n\nEdit: If you have endometriosis and want to get your ovaries out, there is no reason to get rid of the uterus too, because without ovaries you will not have a period any more, thus your uterus will not give you problems ever again.

"Ghost, demon, or spirit?","I started experiencing things at my home 2 weeks ago, I live at home with my family and we have dogs. Our house was built 10 years ago and there’s never been anything paranormal that’s happened before there. I’m not sure what I’m dealing with and am confused why it’s taking multiple different forms. Nobody in my family, nor I, have ever experienced these unexplainable things before, especially at home. My family is very slow to get scared about things/ jump to conclusions. 

The experiences:

1) 2 days ago: I was walking up the stairs at night and the light turned off by itself- everybody else in the house was in bed, and the 2 light switches to this light were visible to me, so I would have seen somebody turn them off. The lightbulb did not burn out and it was the only one to turn off, so it wasn’t a house-wide power issue. Talking about it at dinner the next night, my grandma told me she thought I was trying to prank somebody because of how I screamed outside of her door right as she saw the light go out from under the door. I did not scream or say anything at all when it happened and had no clue what she was talking about. 

2) 5 days ago: My sister was in the bathroom with her door partially opened looking in the mirror. This bathroom is at the top of the staircase and the beginning of a hallway. She heard somebody running up the staircase and one of our dogs chasing them so she figured it was one of us playing with the dogs; through the reflection and the partially opened door, she saw a woman dressed in white running down the hallway with our dog running behind her. She opened the door to see who it was and nobody was there, except our dog at the end of the hallway by itself. 

3) 2 weeks ago: My grandma saw a “shadow figure” out of her peripheral vision walking by the living room, which is near the bottom of the stairs. She was home alone at this time and checked the house and couldn’t find any explanation for this. She said she’s never seen anything like it, and has never told us about seeing anything weird before. 

What might have caused this? Nobody in my house plays with ouija boards or tries to interact with or seek out the paranormal. Here is pertinent background/ changes in the last 2 weeks. 

1) I’m an EMT in a 911 system where we’re responsible for the county’s body removals, and my family is convinced a “spirit” followed me home from work. I don’t think this is the case, they are pre-dead upon arrival and usually it’s not traumatic. 

2) I recently took a trip to Western North Carolina after the flooding from Hurricane Helene to help out the community my extended family owns a cabin in/ I partially grew up in. I returned 2 weeks ago, when the weird stuff at home started happening. There were many deaths in that area, and I walked on the properties where some people had died. One property in particular had a very heavy feeling to it and it felt similar to the feeling I got being at haunted penitentiaries/ psych hospitals before (I haven’t been to one in 4-5 years though). The owner was living out of his horse barn with his dogs for several days after the flood, and “was not in a good head space”; he was told by the air evac team that he could not take his dogs and had 30 minutes to “take care of it”, and he ended up shooting both dogs. I spent a lot of time during my trip there taking care of their horses and doing what I could for their house, and ended up finding one of the horses dead too (colic). The entire property felt haunted, knowing what the owners last few days there were like and with all the death in their backyard. I also spent a lot of time on that property throughout my life and had a lot of emotional ties to it. However, there were no human deaths on that property. In that community, there have also been sightings of a woman dressed in white. It also used to be inhabited by Native Americans; the only knowledge I have about their activity in that community was that their compound used to be where many cabins are now built today. Since returning, I’ve also started smelling death at random times/ places… the smell of death on my one neighbors property with the dogs/ horse was very strong, and it smells just like that. 

3) My sister visited from college for the first time since moving there the weekend I returned from the NC trip. Her dorm room had some unexplained things that happened in it that haven’t happened since she left our house and went back to school. Her visit was 2 weeks ago, the same weekend I returned from my trip. 

4) The property our house is built on is rumored to be the place a man shot his wife and son then killed himself. However, nothing weird or unexplainable has ever happened except for the last 2 weeks (we’ve lived there for over a decade).

TLDR: weird things started happening in my house starting 2 weeks ago, between lights turning off by themselves and hearing screaming, a woman dressed in white that my dog was chasing, and a shadow figure. I’m not sure if this sounds more like a spirit, ghost, or demon, or why this might’ve started happening. I think it might be tied to a trip I returned from 2 weeks ago in an area with a lot of death/ trauma. I’ve also been randomly smelling death (like how I did on my neighbors property) since I got back.

"Buncombe County Helene Recovery Update 10/24 5:00pm: Disaster Recovery Center, Voting, Mountain Mobility, Temporary Housing, Volunteering, Pisgah Legal Services","Good Evening Buncombians! I am sharing the Buncombe County official updates from today for those who are not receiving their emails. By the way, who is excited for the curtain to be installed in the North Fork reservoir tomorrow!?

I have tried to add some quick formatting and headers to make the update easier to read, since they sent it mostly unformatted. Here is the full text:

# Disaster Recovery Center

The Disaster Recovery Center, a one-stop shop where people can get assistance from FEMA and the Small Business Administration, will move from its location at A.C. Reynolds High at the end of the day today due to school reopening. A Mobile Disaster Recovery Center is open today through Sunday at the Bee Tree Fire Station in Swannanoa from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. and at the Buncombe County Sports Park parking lot starting Oct. 28 through Oct. 31 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. 

The Community Care Station at A.C. Reynolds, offering showers, laundry, and more will still operate there. Other Community Care Stations can be found at [buncombeready.org](http://buncombeready.org/) along with food and water sites.

Kids are going to start heading back to school tomorrow, but there are still a number of traffic lights that aren’t working. Please remember that if a traffic light isn’t working, slow down and treat that as a four-way stop. We want to keep our kids safe as they return. 

# Voting

“I told you that Buncombe would vote, and you definitely are,” said Buncombe County Election Services Director Corinne Duncan during her elections update at the 11 a.m. briefing. “Despite driving around pieces of missing roads, stopping at stop lights that still don’t work, boiling your water to cook your food, and mourning losses you are showing up to cast your ballot. You’re making very long lines, and we are happy for it.” 

Over 47,000 voters have cast their vote so far. The voting pattern is different this time around, usually the first days of early voting are highest and then there is a trend down. Not this time - voting is holding steady. This weekend, there will be extended hours for early voting, all 10 locations will be open Saturday and Sunday from 9-5.

Absentee by mail is still available. There are over 15,000 requests and more than 3,000 of those ballots have been returned. Those are being processed at board meetings and everyone is welcome to watch in person or online. 

The deadline to submit an absentee request is Oct. 29. The deadline to turn in ballots is Election Day, Nov. 5 at 7:30 p.m. 

Due to Helene, not all of the usual Election Day locations are available to use. All 80 precincts have been accessed and it was determined that 17 need to be moved or transferred to another polling location. We have published those changes on our website and are sending change cards in the mail now to all voters that have a new location. 

# Free Community Transport To Vote

Buncombe County’s community transportation service, Mountain Mobility, is providing direct access to three early voting sites via the Trailblazer routes. **Customers using any of the three Trailblazer routes will be able to use the following sites:**

Qualifying Mountain Mobility customers may take trips to other voting sites. 

# Meeting Temporary Housing Needs 

Getting families out of shelters and hotels and into longer-term solutions is a priority and FEMA’s Direct Lease & Multifamily Lease and Repair Programs help families find more stable housing while continue their recovery. FEMA is currently seeking interested, qualified owners or property management companies to help meet the temporary housing needs for Hurricane Helene survivors by leasing their properties directly to FEMA. FEMA is hosting a webinar this afternoon from 2-4 p.m. for property managers and residential property owners who are interested in learning more about leasing directly to FEMA. We will add the link to register for this webinar in the chat. 

# Debris Pickup

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is now handling storm debris pickup in Buncombe County. The Corps is operating in Buncombe County and in all impacted county in Western North Carolina. They were already managing debris removal for rivers, streams, and mudslides, and now they’ll be managing all other storm debris in the County.

# Volunteering

United Way has activated several ways for individuals and groups to volunteer. 

Hands-On Asheville Buncombe, an online platform that assists with the mobilization of the thousands of volunteers that will be necessary to recover from this disaster in the days, months and years ahead.   
Volunteer Reception Center at [50 S. French Broad Ave](https://www.google.com/maps/search/50+S.+French+Broad+Ave?entry=gmail&source=g). open every day from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. United Way has partnered with Buncombe County and Lutheran Disaster Response and Relief to launch an in-person Volunteer Reception Center (VRC) to serve as a hub for individuals and groups of volunteers who wish to volunteer to simply walk in whenever the center is open and they will be connected to whatever recovery efforts need volunteers that day. To contact the center, email [uwabcvrc@gmail.com](mailto:uwabcvrc@gmail.com) or call 813-485-1354. 

Partners, including national disaster recovery organizations, can register their volunteer opportunities on Hands-On, which will automatically register them for the VRC at the same time. Email the Hands On team at [info@handsonasheville.org](mailto:info@handsonasheville.org) or call 828-393-5628. 

The United Way warehouse, which operated in partnership with Buncombe County to receive and distribute supply donations, is now closed. In the three weeks since opening the warehouse, we received and distributed 76 pallets and 2,606 boxes of essential supplies to dozens of frontline community partners. Thank you to the 427 volunteers who donated over 3,000 hours.

Demoted from manager position,"Hi, I (22M) was just demoted from a management position at my job. It was pretty heartbreaking, I'm not gonna lie. It's not some business or career job, I've worked at this restaurant for over 2 years and have been a manager for the past 9 months. It was going great, I didn't have any issues as a manager and things were fine. Then a month ago hurricane Helene hit (Western NC) and my life got turned upside down. I lost my car, our kitchen flooded, and our town was pushed into a terrible place. Ultimately we were lucky compared to others, but it still affected me and my bf severely. I returned to work just a few days later and worked tirelessly on helping get us back up and running while many of our workers and managers were out of town. Now a month later our town is thankfully mostly back to normal, but I've continued to be in a terrible haze and stress. My last three days of work were rough. We've been doing large catering orders every morning before open for the past 3 weeks, and mine had mostly been successful and gone fine. I asked for a specific piece of help for one morning, having an additional person on, and was told I would have it. The day came and I did not have any more help on then original. It went fine, but not great. I also had a poor close one night and a rough morning shift one other day. Nothing went terribly wrong, we were just delayed in some areas and short on some prep as I made the poor decision to go lighter considering our business has been way down. Well, it ended up being the busiest day we had since. My boss sat me down and we talked about how I was doing, what I could focus on and how I could do better at my job. It was a discussion entirely about getting me back on track and making sure I was prepared for getting back into the swing of things. No indication of being demoted. Then today he called me on my day off and told me that he had decided to demote me (which also reduces my pay) and that while he would love to keep me on the team, that he felt it just wasn't working. He offered to let me take time in the backseat and work my way up to manager again if I wanted it, but I'm past my point with this place for many other reasons, this has probably just put in place that I will be leaving. I told him I would for sure be working out the next two weeks, but that I would have to let him know whether or not I would be staying after that. I will not be, but I wanted to hold off on saying that until I get some feelers out for other jobs. I'm exhausted and beyond stressed, and this just added a significant amount of weight on my life and my financials. I cried it out for a while, and then started looking at job openings, and then took a long nap. I work the next three days, two of which I was managing for but will now have him in managing those shifts instead. I don't even know what to say anymore, I just want to leave this place on good terms so that they will be a good recommendation for me, but I'm stressed about working the next two weeks. On of my previously mentioned issues with this place is the environment. My coworkers are all heinous shit talkers and everything gets so drama focused there, I was getting tired of that BS by itself w/o several other factors on top. I'm just tired and know I'll be dealing with people saying things about my demotion and self as I've already heard some of it over this past week. I know I shouldn't let them get to me or listen to it, but I just don't want to have to deal with any of it at all. 
Not sure what I'm looking for while positing this. Advice? Kind words? Good messages? Idk, it just felt like something I had to get off my chest.
I've never been fired or demoted from a job before and this feeling of rejection has really gotten to me. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1gbhgjf/demoted_from_manager_position/,1729815357.0,disavventure420,jobs,[]

Two CPAPs Died in Two Weeks,"A week after hurricane Helene, I found that my CPAP, which I’d been using for months before with no issues, had broken, presumably due to power surge issues caused by the storm. When I plugged it in and took the power cord out it would make a single flicker on the On button before going back to being completely unresponsive. I took it to my provider and they said yep, totally fried. They were nice enough to provide me a new one for free. 

Cut to two weeks after the fact, and I have the exact same problem on my hands, and this time I don’t have a historically bad storm to pin the probable cause of death on. I have no idea how this happened. I’m kind of freaking out because I don’t think they’ll replace another one for free. Does anyone know what’s going on?

Listen to emergency services ,"Hey everyone,

I’m selling programmed radios where you can listen to all Long Beach Police divisions, Long Beach fire department, And surrounding Sheriff departments( Compton,Carson,Lakewood,Norwalk) 
Yes you can stream these frequencies online, But you can hear it all live with one radio as apposed multiple streams. 

These radios came in handy during Hurricane Helene on the south east, Where cell phone signals went out. People relied on radios like this to listen in on ham radio repeaters to seek information. 

Don’t solely rely on your cell phone !
For $40 for each radio, It’s a cheap way to stay connected.

Travel Insurance - Hurricane Helene claim denied ,"We were planning to go to Anna Maria Island, Florida, in September, given hurricane season we took out trip cancellation insurance with Allianz. I only insured the value of the hotel and only put in a claim for the hotel. We cancelled when it became apparent how bad the forecast for Hurricane Helene looked. That area was under a mandatory evacuation, the hotel we booked was closed the day of our first night of stay and it is still closed because of all of the damage. Unfortunately that area was hit very hard.

I submitted the claim with a lot of detail on the details of the before and after of the situation and after about a month they rejected it for the following reason: ""Your insurance program provided Trip Cancellation benefits for very specific reasons. Unfortunately, destination being uninhabitable is not included among those reasons.""

On the surface I find it unbelievable that trip cancellation insurance doesn't cover our circumstance! Reading through the policy I see the following under covered reasons: ""Strikes, **natural disasters** or severe weather resulting in the complete cessation of services by the airline, the tour operator or the cruise line for at least 24 consecutive hours. The Company will not cover losses resulting from strikes of the person, organization, agency, or tour operator, or their affiliated companies, that solicited this coverage, and/or Your insured travel arrangements to you"".

I would appreciate opinions on two things please:

1. I am pretty outraged by this, should I be?

Senior Semester Rant,"I'm in my final semester as a Computer Science student. I feel so lazy and am experiencing extreme ""idgaf"" energy. I don't really think it's senioritis. Because I was so motivated at the beginning of this semester, but Hurricane Helene (in USA) mixed with fall break (2 days off) virtually set classes back about 2 1/2 weeks....

After this, I have struggled to regain any focus. I am taking 5 classes, but 2 are ""dummy"" classes I barely put in any effort. The other 3 are advanced CS courses and the assignments are.. 😵‍💫😵‍💫 Not to mention one of them is my Senior Project class.

For my Senior Project, we have to do a presentation on our project every week. I was thinking of bailing my presentation tomorrow. The only thing that stopped me is a different assignment which is due today got updated late penalties.. Only -15% if you submit this Sunday.... To think that is what saved me this week.. It's so sad 😂😂😂😭😭",https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1gbec09/senior_semester_rant/,1729806478.0,KristPeraya,GetStudying,[]
How to remove rusted+stripped taillight bolts?,"So Ill start off by saying I don’t know much about working on cars(though I desperately need to learn to maintain my car)but need to figure out how to get these off so I can replace a bulb. The guys inspecting my car(2006 Subaru forester)at valvoline told me they couldn’t get it off since they’re stripped and don’t have the right tools, and I’d have to take it to a full service mechanic. 
However, I can’t afford to do so right now as I lost my job due to hurricane Helene, so I’m tight on money. 

I’m wondering if there any specific tools I could buy to do it myself, and how I’d go about the process.

Does stress prevent ovulation or just delay it?,"Hi all,

Curious if anyone who has missed a menstrual cycle due to stress knows this: does stress just delay ovulation? Or does it cause you to miss ovulation all together?

I'm currently on CD 49 when my cycles are usually \~32 days (granted I haven't had many cycles...just came off Mirena in late May, but 32 days has been consistent since then). I usually ovulate around CD 20, give or take a day, and luteal phases are between 12-14 days.

Since the last time I ovulated (mid/late August), I had emergency dental surgery while on vacation, was on the road for two weeks after that, then had my city basically wiped out by Hurricane Helene – we didn't have cell signal for days, no power or wifi for two weeks, no water for three weeks (and it's still not potable), and we've lived with my in-laws for almost a month. So yeah...it's been a couple of stressful months 🫠

My Premom OPK was 1.01 the day before the hurricane came through, but progesterone never went up after (I use Mira to track) which is how I knew ovulation didn't occur. I've taken a few pregnancy tests, all negative which I expected tbh (again, progesterone never went up); most recent negative was last Sunday.

I'm fiiiiiinally starting to get some sore boobs (a telltale AF sign for me) which makes me hopeful a period is on it's way. And if it is...does that mean I ovulated, just way later? Or would it just be ""breakthrough bleeding""? And is there a way to tell the difference between the two? Despite the stress factors, we've still managed to BD fairly regularly throughout this whole cycle, so I can't help myself from hoping just a little that maybe we hit it late...

I'm sure it's nuanced from person to person, but any insight would be appreciated ♥️",https://www.reddit.com/r/TryingForABaby/comments/1gbazn2/does_stress_prevent_ovulation_or_just_delay_it/,1729797813.0,LaDolceRenee,TryingForABaby,"[{'Comment Author': 'AutoModerator', 'Comment Body': 'Please make sure that you have [read all of our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/TryingForABaby/wiki/rules) before commenting!

And I have "" the advantage"" of getting ovulation pain almost every cycle. Having all this info I am always sure about my fertile days, not that it helps much with our MFI. But some women don\'t like measuring BBT or get too rocky temperatures and prefer OPKs, everybody has their preferences.'}]"
