Quick Update on the Biden-Harris Administration’s Response to Hurricane Helene.,"We’re continuing to surge resources to Georgia to make sure communities have everything they need to recover and rebuild. So far, FEMA has approved over $48 million in assistance for more than 59,000 survivors. And, FEMA Disaster Survivor Assistance Teams are on the ground continuing to help survivors apply for FEMA assistance and connect them with additional state, local, federal, and voluntary agency resources.  
  
Our Administration will be here for as long as it takes to recover and rebuild. We encourage survivors to apply for FEMA assistance, which can be done by:  
- Calling 1-800-621-3362  
- Visiting [DisasterAssistance.gov](http://DisasterAssistance.gov)

That's 2 jets for every square mile of Gaza (about the size of the Georgia Tech campus). If Israel really wanted to commit genocide, they could reduce the population of Gaza to 0 in a long weekend. The only limiting factor would be runway space to refuel and rearm. That's not even taking into consideration helicopters, armored vehicles, MLRS, artillery, ground troops, and naval bombardment.   \n  \nSo if Israel's goal is the elimination of all Palestinians from Gaza, they are doing a piss poor job of it. 40,000 casualties in a year of war? Those are rookie numbers. We lose that many every year to gun violence, and about the same to car accidents.

I’ve spoken to\xa0the\xa0governor, spent time with him, and he told \\[Trump\\] he’s lying.

He said that he made very clear he didn't want to impede disaster and relief efforts, and would also do aerial tours of Asheville. I find it so ironic that the people who claim they hate big government and would also defund all these federal agencies are now also upset that the Fed isn't doing enough, but also blaming Biden for not showing up immediately? Like you can easily look up this information to see what is true or not, but no people would rather believe their local GOP person or whatever Twitter account they follow that spews garbage.\n\nJust yesterday, there were a lot of posts on this subreddit blaming Biden and FEMA for not approving Tennessee's state of emergency request. They made it sound as if the delay in federal support for the state during the devastation of Helene was Biden’s fault. Totally ignoring that Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina all declared emergencies and requested and received federal approval of those declarations before the hurricane hit, Governor Lee of TN did not.\xa0 Instead, Gov Lee proclaimed September 27 “a voluntary Day of Prayer & Fasting.” Lee did not declare a state of emergency until late on September 27, after flash flooding had already created havoc. President Biden approved it immediately.\xa0\xa0\n\nLike I understand if people view politics as a team sport, even if I don't agree with that position. I understand if they want to critique certain politicians. My thing is you can do all that without making shit up, and yet that seems to be a core part of the GOP and Conservative platform under Trump is to make shit up, and they are comfortable doing it because it plays into their bias and supports their narrative even if it is false.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that FEMA and the Federal government have sent over 1,500 federal personnel to the regions affected by the hurricane, as well as about 8,000 members of the U.S. Coast Guard and teams from the Army Corps of Engineers to provide emergency power. It has provide two health and medical task forces to help local hospitals and critical care facilities, and sent in more than 2.7 million meals, 1.6 million liters of water, 50,000 tarps, 10,000 cots, 20,000 blankets, 70,000 gallons of diesel fuel, and 40,000 gallons of gasoline to provide supplies for those hit by the catastrophe.\xa0\n\nThe idea that a 100 year storm is just something that shouldn't affect us is naive, and at this point if you believe anything Donald Trump says at face value, I have to question your intelligence as well as intent.""}, {'Comment Author': 'None', 'Comment Body': 'If his lips are moving then he’s lying'}, {'Comment Author': 'LeeOCD', 'Comment Body': ""I've been around a long time and voted for my fair share of Republicans.

Hurricane Helene - No Joke! Prepare Now!,"Current forecasts show 6-10 inches of rain prior to the wind impact. Due to the strength and speed of the storm movement anything to the east of the storm center in n central georgia is likely to see multiple hours of 70+ mph gusts. As the storm accelerates around the axis of a secondary low pressure situated in Alabama the forward speed of the storm will be added to maximum winds experienced on the east side of the storm. The NAM model is currently showing gusts approaching 100 mph at 10 meters in the ATL metroplex at 5am friday. 

Both the rain and wind maximum could change prior to the event but if the modeled situation occurs it would likely result in one of the most prolonged power and water outages to impact a metro area in recent history. With tree density, preceding soil saturation and power and internet lines being almost fully above ground it could be several weeks until power, water and internet are fully restored.

Hoping the models are wrong or will shift the worst impacts elsewhere, but as of now this is what you should prepare for.


--UPDATE--

My post was referencing the NAM model as of yesterday evening and was the only publicly available model I could find that had estimated gusts versus estimated sustained winds which I feel is more relevant to treefall.

Storm strength at landfall, the orientation of the secondary low pressure to the west and direct storm path in relation to the east/strong side of the system will all be extremely important to the ultimate wind impact.

It seems as if all 3 factors have been reduced in magnitude since yesterday's model suites, which is good news. However, it is possible that things shift again to a worse scenario so please continue to monitor the situation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Georgia/comments/1fow4op/hurricane_helene_no_joke_prepare_now/,1727238219.0,Agreeable_Peach_6202,Georgia,"[{'Comment Author': 'Sea_Actuator7689', 'Comment Body': 'As someone whose home is surrounded by tall Georgia pines, those winds scare me to death.'}, {'Comment Author': 'johnpseudo', 'Comment Body': ""It looks like they're saying it's very unlikely that we'll see hurricane strength winds in Atlanta: https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/refresh/graphics_at4+shtml/094338.shtml?hwind120#wcontents\n\nThat rain looks like no joke though. 10 inches of rain, with how dry it's been, is definitely going to cause a lot of flooding.""}, {'Comment Author': 'zxphoenix', 'Comment Body': 'Here’s a link to the NHC (National Hurricane Center)’s [key messages](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/refresh/graphics_at4+shtml/033010.shtml?key_messages#contents).\n\nFor Atlanta, there is a [42% chance of us having experienced 39mph+ wind by 2am Saturday](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIAPWSAT4+shtml/250853.shtml?).

If you have a long power outage, if the freezer gets warm enough to melt the ice, the quarter will drop to the side or bottom. When power comes back on, if you open your freezer and this has happened, it means all the food needs to be discarded because it has thawed. \n\nDo not open the fridge any more than absolutely necessary (for, say, medical reasons like insulin or pre-prepared breast milk) as this will help the food stay cool longer. Ideally you would be able to keep these in your cooler but if that’s not an option, don’t open the fridge unless you truly must. \n\nIf you have battery banks for your cell phone, charge them now. \n\nTake anything that could become projectile out of your yard and off your porch/balcony. Bird feeders, chairs, flags, potted plants, patio furniture. \n\nIf you have camping supplies or have access to a stocked store like Walmart, grab a few battery powered headlamps- they are great for hands-free visibility in the dark. Lanterns and flashlights are a must as well. \n\nIf you have pets, if the storm sounds bad, have a plan to get them out of the house safely. Keep cats in a small room and have carriers handy. \n\nCheck where your car is— if it’s near a lot of trees, can you get out safely if they come down? If not, consider parking it somewhere nearby your home but away from any potential roadblocks like large trees, fences that could obstruct an evacuation, etc. \n\n20 oz bottles of drinking water can be frozen ahead of time and use them as ice packs. They can double as drinking water if power is out so long that they melt. \n\nTake photos of any irreplaceable documents. If for any reason you think you may need to evacuate with your pets, go ahead and take photos of their vaccine records, because some evacuation shelters will not allow you to admit pets without proof of a vaccine. \n\nKeep anything you’ll want to snag for emergency evacuation (diaper bag, purse, emergency supplies, powdered baby formula, pet carriers, etc) all in one place. In a panic, you will have everything where you need. \n\nKeep in mind sandwiches are great for non-cooked food, but without electricity and AC, bread molds quickly so have some other non perishables available too. \n\nI’m forgetting some stuff but that’s the off the top ones I’ve got from years of living on the coast. Hopefully all will be fine, but it’s better to be prepared!'}, {'Comment Author': 'Yleira', 'Comment Body': 'On the ""want not need"" list: a DeWalt fan.

We didn\'t have power for two weeks, and we weren\'t the last ones to have our power back on. And by that time Hugo hit Charlotte, it was a tropical storm with the occasional hurricane-force gusts.

FEMA has dedicated disaster relief money that cannot be used for other purposes. Separately, it was tasked by Congress in 2022 to disseminate money from Customs and Border Protection to help communities that received influxes of migrants.\n\nNo money is being diverted from disaster response needs. FEMA’s disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster efforts,” FEMA said in its post. “Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts.”\n\nFEMA added: “FEMA has enough money right now for immediate response and recovery needs. If you were affected by Helene, do not hesitate to apply for disaster assistance as there is a variety of help available for different needs.”\n\nFEMA did administer $640 million in grants from Customs and Border Protection in 2024 and about $364 million in 2023 to cities and counties that serve migrants. *However, that program called the Shelter and Services Program, or SSP, is separate from FEMA’s disaster relief fund which is more than $20 billion*.

They stayed in Puerto Rico and the other shithole countries because I told them too. And if I had been your president, this hurricane would’ve stayed away from the United States as well, because I would’ve told them to. But I’m not your president so what could I do? That was Sleepy Joe’s job and he failed America on that too. And so did Kamala—where was she? Why didn’t she tell the hurricane to stay away?

Sending politicians in does absolutely nothing nothing but cause issues. I wouldn’t want Joe Biden or Trump or Harris, or any politician deciding what is and isn’t needed to handle cleanup and rescue efforts after a natural disaster, I want the fema folks and the department of homeland security to handle all that and for those other politicians to just assist them in whatever capacity they require. \n\nAnd while we are at it, we should stop sending camera crews for all these random places in as well… every additional person on site, that isn’t trained on how to handle these situations, is an increased liability. Police and firefighters have body and helmet cams, and many ambulance providers have their employees wear body cams as well. Footage from these would be more than enough to show the outside world what is happening, if that is so important. But honestly, I don’t think it is… it’s the equivalent of rubber necking at the scene of an accident. Just let the experts do their jobs and listen to what they tell you… this situation would have been significantly less catastrophic if people would have listened to the evacuation orders, but like always, they ignored every single warning until they finally realized they shouldn’t have ignored them and by that time it was too late. Not only were they telling people to evacuate, but they literally said if you weren’t going to evacuate, write your name, date of birth, and any other important info on your arm or leg in permanent marker so it can be used to identify your body later… because they knew it was going to be serious going into this…\n\n\nAs a former firefighter and EMT, nothing irritates me more than seeing stupid people do stupid things because they don’t believe what the experts are telling them… the number of times I’ve heard “oh they always say we have a tornado warning but we never actually get a tornado…” makes me want to drag these idiots along with me to the houses just a few blocks away that did get hit and show them the corpses of children we have to remove….

Hurricane Helene ,"I work with a state-wide organization, so I frequently speak with people from all over Georgia. 

I was on a work call earlier this week & someone from a county in SW Georgia (not affected by the hurricane) kept referring to the storm as ""Helena"" & referred to it as ""the power outage"" in neighboring counties. 

The next day, I was on a call with a different group. This group is typically more mindful of what is going on in the state. Zero mention of the hurricane or resources or anything. I reached out to them, because I thought I missed something storm related (kept cutting in & out). Nope... The next day someone from there sent me an email with a link to GEMA. 

I've spoken to several people who didn't realize that it was so bad or that we were without power for so long (there are still folks in Coffee & Jeff Davis Counties without power). Our county is still mostly without internet services & for some reason our cell services have been in & out since the storm. There are still intersections in town without working lights & debris cleanup will be ongoing for weeks or months. 

I know it hit mostly rural Georgia, so it's not a huge portion of the state population... but, if you're interacting with anyone from the path, please be mindful that it's completely turned our lives upside down. We're exhausted & having to make up work... While dealing with cleaning up, repairs, insurance, contractors, FEMA, not having internet or cell data, losing crops, losing homes, losing vehicles, & losing loved ones. 

At least have the decency & self-awareness to get the name of the fucking storm correct.

They\'re actively avoiding coming into their backyard just so they don\'t have to deal with any of the 4 peoples yards their shit fucked over) And to top that off I had to shell out for starlink equipment to do my job because no one had internet, ATT doesn\'t have enough signal at my house, Verizon currently only has SOS at my house, and T-Mobile doesn\'t service our address with their 5g home internet. And while my provider uses t mobile towers and I have full bars, I only have so much data in which to hotspot with. \n  \n I will say we are lucky that all we lost was a single shingle, some flashing, a fence and our shed (and it\'s contents.

FEMA has created a tool to fight misinformation and rumors around hurricane response,"Due to the rampant misinformation and rumors about the disaster response, FEMA has [just released a tool ](https://www.fema.gov/disaster/current/hurricane-helene/rumor-response)that allows you to search for common misinformation and find FEMA's official response. Here's an example:

**Rumor:**  

FEMA is in the process of confiscating Helene survivor property. If I apply for disaster assistance and my land is deemed unlivable, my property will be seized.

**Fact:**

FEMA cannot seize your property or land. Applying for disaster assistance does not grant FEMA or the federal government authority or ownership of your property or land. When you apply for disaster assistance a FEMA inspector may be sent to verify the damage on your home. This is one of many factors reviewed to determine what kind of disaster assistance you may be eligible for. If the results of the inspection deem your home uninhabitable, that information is only used to determine the amount of FEMA assistance you may receive to make your home safe, sanitary and functional.

The program is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in partnership with U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nThis includes almost $17 million to the Catholic Charities Archdiocese of San Antonio, which received over $10 million in a previous tranche of Shelter and Service funds released in April.\n\nHowever, two lawmakers told Border Report when the first batch of Fiscal Year 2024 SSP funds were released that they questioned how Catholic Charities of San Antonio was spending the money and they were concerned with reports that airline tickets were being bought for migrants to travel to other U.S. cities with these funds.\n\nSan Antonio nonprofit ‘misused’ federal funds to buy migrants airline tickets, lawmaker says\nU.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, who at the time was ranking member of the House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, helped to set up this program. He told Border Report it was never intended to supply airline tickets for migrants to travel. The money is intended to reimburse non-governmental organizations and municipalities for food and shelter and toiletry expenses they incur housing asylum-seekers who cross the border, he said.\n\n“When I first started this program, I said it would only be used for food and shelter, maybe transportation inside a city, but not to be sending them up there. The family or somebody should pay for that, not the taxpayer dollars,” Cuellar told Border Report in April.\n\nU.S. Rep. Monica De La Cruz, a Republican from South Texas, also told Border Report these tax dollars were “not intended to be used to fly illegal immigrants all over their country to the destination of their choice.”\n\n\nCatholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley received over $10 million in the latest FEMA Shelter and Service program funds.

The short term holding is where you saw the kids in cages and families in what looked like 3rd world prisons for reference. Clearly not meant to hold people for days or weeks, let alone months.\n\nThe 650M is allocated for that program.

The head of DEd decides that money would be better spent, against the legislative branch's decision, on providing vouchers for children to attend private schools instead. It would be a huge scandal, children would go hungry and do worse in school all on the whims of one unelected person. States and local school districts then have to scramble and cut other programs or find additional sources of funding to offset the money they were planning on in their budgeting. \n\n That's why it's important that Congress, as is their right and responsibility, to either reappropriate unspent funds or pass additional funding or authorize the head of DHS to be able to reappropriate the funds through law (I strongly disagree with the last option because it's more unchecked power for an unelected role but it is an option I believe). \n\n\nAs an aside, don't worry about feeling uneducated.

Hurricane Helene Roof Damage,"I'm located in South Georgia, and my roof (3,100 sq ft) had shingles ripped off due to wind damage from Hurricane Helene.

When repairing a shingle on a slope, 80% of the time the surrounding shingles will be damaged in the process leading to more damage to the roof from the initial repair.

Senator Warnock Update: Resources for Georgians following Hurricane Helene,"Hi Everyone, 

I got an email from Senator Warnock regarding Hurricane Helene. Figured it might be helpful to share with everyone as it contains information that you can share with your community, friends and family. Especially as it relates to aid. Also don't fall for the scams! The Federal government has committed to covering 100% of the cost for debris removal for the next 3 months as requested by Gov Kemp in GA. Don't let scammers or greedy people tell you otherwise.

**> Dear Georgians,**

> I pray that you and your loved ones are all safe in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene’s devastating landfall in our state. I join Georgians all over in mourning those we have lost during this awful storm, and I am immensely grateful for the first responders who have risked their lives to keep our communities safe.    
  
> My office is monitoring on-going recovery efforts and has been in frequent contact with Federal, state, and local officials to ensure our communities get the help they need. Along with my colleagues in the Georgia delegation, I successfully urged President Biden to approve a federal Emergency Declaration for all 159 counties in Georgia, giving our state access to much needed federal emergency resources and assistance to supplement state and local preparation and response efforts. I’m also pushing to deliver additional aid and relief to aid Georgians in need, through a federal Major Disaster declaration. At [my request](https://outreach.senate.gov/iqextranet/iqClickTrk.aspx?&cid=SenWarnock&crop=17180.17598692.7248866.14557179&report_id=&redirect=https%3a%2f%2fwww.ossoff.senate.gov%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2024%2f09%2f24.09.30_Sen.-Ossoff-Georgia-Delegation-Letter-to-Biden.pdf&redir_log=467840313863773), the President has declared a number of counties eligible for individual and public assistance. You can view the current list of counties here: [https://www.fema.gov/disaster/4830/designated-areas](https://outreach.senate.gov/iqextranet/iqClickTrk.aspx?&cid=SenWarnock&crop=17180.17598692.7248866.14557179&report_id=&redirect=https%3a%2f%2fwww.fema.gov%2fdisaster%2f4830%2fdesignated-areas&redir_log=620164849347350).

 

**> In the interim, I wanted to share some resources to help you and your communities stay safe and begin to recover during this difficult time.**   
  
**> First and foremost, if you require immediate emergency assistance, please dial 911. For non-damage related questions, you can call 211 for assistance.**

"I am trying to find out if the Governor of Georgia actually used any of the money from the infrastructure bill Biden passed for bridge and road repairs, and if so which roads and bridges?","I had a conversation with my Dad today who asked me ""what happened to all that money from the infrastructure bill""?  We were talking about an article we read about how many roads and bridges in Georgia got obliterated from Hurricane Helene and how they were in disrepair which made them less stable to withstanding floods.  He thinks the federal government wasted all that money.  Did the governor use any of that money for its intended purposes?  I believe the funds were given out to the states back in 2022.  Anyone know?  I found one website that said states had zero stipulations attacked to those federal funds and given wide attitude on how it was spent.

We do a LOT of work for GDOT, GTC, solar farms, etc. Lots of infrastructure work. Here\'s what I\'ve seen.\n\n1. Yes, lots of that government money has been taken by the state and put towards infrastructure projects. Georgia has been on a bridge repair/replacement kick for many years now, actually. Long before the ""infrastructure bill"". But the pace has certainly increased. Although, my sense is that more of it is going towards developing power infrastructure in rural parts of the state.\n\n2. Bridge projects take F O R E V E R. They just do. The environmental and cultural impacts feom.bdodges are typically much more common/intense than other kinds of development (other than hydro), because they cross creeks, streams, and rivers. These are obviously environmentally sensitive areas, but they\'re also areas with a high probability for having important archaeological sites that have to be surveyed, excavated, and mitigated. That\'s not to say it\'s archaeology holding up most of these projects, just pointing out that there\'s a hell of a lot more that goes into a bridge replacement than ""tear the old one down and put a new one up"". And a lot of people don\'t consider it. \n\n3. Politically, it\'s always better to build a new bridge than to repair an obsolete one. In a lot of cases, it\'s also cheaper. So (and this goes for the whole country), a LOT of our bridges are old and falling apart and we don\'t fix them because hey it didn\'t fall down yesterday and it *probably* won\'t fall down today and it\'d cost a gazillion dollars and take 5 years to fix and we\'d have to build a whole new road and bridge to carry the traffic anyway while we fix THIS bridge so maybe we just ignore the problem and then thoughts and prayers/blame the other party when it collapses and someone dies...'}, {'Comment Author': 'MrAudacious817', 'Comment Body': 'I can think of like 7 different places within a half hour of me that have been converted to dual bridge designs.

Application for FEMA still pending,"I live in Lanier County, Georgia. Hurricane Helene came through us and destroyed  our town. On October 1st we were declared as a disaster area and was told to apply for FEMA. My house is a rental and I have no rental insurance. We had a lot of shingles come off the roof so our landlord is replacing that. We did have a power surge when our lights went out and ended up having our tv, computer, washer, dryer, and stove fried. I applied October 1st with FEMA for personal property damage, housing assistance (my 7 year old is disabled and we were trying to get into a hotel), and MISC essential needs ($750). We had been without lights and water since around midnight Thursday. Oct. 2nd we got a notice stating we were denied because we were in a undeclared area. I reached out to FEMA and was told to ignore that letter since it can take 48 hours for the system to ackowledge that Lanier was declared. I gave it 3 days and still didn't hear back. I reached out to a few friends who got the same letter and was told that on October 4th their MISC showed approved now. I checked my account and still nothing from FEMA. The MISC isn't even showing on my dashboard but customer service rep confirmed it on their end that I did apply for it. I was told that I am suppose to have an inspection but its been pending since the 1st. I applied for my mom on October 3rd and she already had her inspection and received the $750. My neighbor also had his house inspected this past Monday and he applied over the weekend. I decided to call in this morning about it. The first rep said the account is stuck on pending status cause I am in a declared area and told me to call 211 and hung up. The second rep said because I put minor damage and still lived in the house that I wouldn't have an inspection done and that the $750 was still pending and that there is nothing they could do other than wait for their system to approve or deny it then do an appeal if it gets denied. Is anyone else going through this that applied around Oct. 1st?

Hurricane Recovery Resources - Sent by Raphael Warnock,"I got this email and thought I should share the resources in case anyone isn't on his email list.

Dear Georgians,
 
I pray that you and your loved ones are all safe in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene’s devastating landfall in our state. I join Georgians all over in mourning those we have lost during this awful storm, and I am immensely grateful for the first responders who have risked their lives to keep our communities safe.  

My office is monitoring on-going recovery efforts and has been in frequent contact with Federal, state, and local officials to ensure our communities get the help they need. Along with my colleagues in the Georgia delegation, I successfully urged President Biden to approve a federal Emergency Declaration for all 159 counties in Georgia, giving our state access to much needed federal emergency resources and assistance to supplement state and local preparation and response efforts. I’m also pushing to deliver additional aid and relief to aid Georgians in need, through a federal Major Disaster declaration. At my request, the President has declared a number of counties eligible for individual and public assistance. You can view the current list of counties here: https://www.fema.gov/disaster/4830/designated-areas.
 
In the interim, I wanted to share some resources to help you and your communities stay safe and begin to recover during this difficult time. 

First and foremost, if you require immediate emergency assistance, please dial 911. For non-damage related questions, you can call 211 for assistance.

For additional assistance, such as food, water, or shelter-related questions:
The Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency (GEMA) has compiled a list of resources related to food, shelter, and donations here: https://gema.georgia.gov/hurricane-helene.  
You can contact your local Emergency Management Agency, which can be found here: https://gema.georgia.gov/locations. If you cannot reach your local agency, you can contact the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency (GEMA) at 404-635-7200 or 1-800-TRYGEMA (1-800-879-4362).
Georgians receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistant Program (SNAP) benefits can report food lost by submitting Form 841 to the Georgia Division of Family & Children Services, either at a county office (https://dfcs.georgia.gov/locations) or electronically: https://dfcs.georgia.gov/form/food-loss-replacement-form. More information is available here: https://dfcs.georgia.gov/snap-food-stamps/benefits-replacement-request.
You can also contact your local American Red Cross Regional Office. The contact information for their Georgia offices is available at https://www.redcross.org/local/georgia.html or 1-800-RED-CROSS (1-800-733-2767) 24 hours a day.
You can also find more information about locating a loved one through the American Red Cross here: https://www.redcross.org/get-help/disaster-relief-and-recovery-services/contact-and-locate-loved-ones.html. 
For those recovering from hurricane-related damage: 

You can report damages to your home, business, or other property here: https://damage-assessment-gema-soc.hub.arcgis.com/.  
You can find resources and apply for disaster assistance here: https://www.disasterassistance.gov/.

The Federal government also operates a 24/7 Disaster Distress Helpline for toll-free, multilingual, crisis support service for those experiencing emotional distress related to natural or human-caused disasters. You can call or text 1-800-985-5990 or learn more here: https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/disaster-distress-helpline.

It is important that agricultural producers keep detailed records of damages and report them to their local USDA Service Center as soon as possible.
Unfortunately, frauds and scams can be common following a disaster, but there are steps you can take to protect yourself:

As a reminder, federal agencies will never charge you for disaster assistance. 
If you believe you may have been the victim of a fraud or scam, you can contact the Georgia’s Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Division at 404-651-8600 or 1-800-869-1123 (toll-free in Georgia) or online at https://consumer.georgia.gov/ and report it to the Federal Trade Commission at https://reportfraud.ftc.gov.

Finally, you can read more about the activities of the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency at https://www.fema.gov/hurricane-helene (Spanish: https://www.fema.gov/es/helene) and across Federal agencies at https://usa.gov/hurricane-helene (Spanish: https://www.usa.gov/es/huracan-helene).  

As your U.S. Senator, the safety of Georgians is my top priority. My office will continue to work to ensure that all Federal resources are leveraged to assist communities across Georgia as they become available.  My staff are available to answer questions and help you find local resources for further assistance. Anyone seeking assistance from my office can call (770) 694-7828. 

During a recent visit to Augusta, which was hit hard by the hurricane, I surveyed storm damage, delivered supplies and met with local leaders and community members to hear what they needed from Washington in this challenging moment. But even in our darkest hour, what I saw in Augusta—and what I know about people in every corner of our state—is that Georgians are resilient, love their community, and come together during tough times. And know that I will keep walking with you as I continue to work for you. 

Keep the faith,

Made the best of things and had a wonderful day!,"Because our trip to Cumberland Island was canceled due to impending Hurricane Helene, we made the best of things and had a great day.

Drove to Jekyll Island and walked on Driftwood Beach. What a gorgeous place! 

From there, we decided to go check out Brunswick. Walked around the historic downtown area a bit and had an excellent Southern lunch at Indigo Coastal Shanty washed down with sweet tea. Highly recommend if anyone goes to Brunswick.

Then we headed back to St. Marys and took a walk through the Oak Grove Cemetery where revolutionary war soldiers are buried (we Yanks don’t see that at home!).

Everywhere we have been, the roads/highways/freeways/backroads have been free of litter. I always pay attention to that, and it’s been lovely to see.

Now we are back at our Airbnb hoping the hurricane doesn’t bother us or anyone else.

Question on what to do regarding trees,"We had some rough issues with hurricane Helene, especially with the trees falling like everyone else. However we have a new problem.

I called 911, the dispatcher said they can’t do anything without the power company because  it’s an electrical issue. I filed TWO reports for them on two separate occasions about this tree limb.

A tale of two pictures ,"We Georgians had a pretty dry summer. It wasn't anything too serious, but see how the hurricane wiped out virtually all dry affected areas. I thought it was pretty cool to see such a drastic difference. When we normally get big storm fronts, they usually only punch holes or down grade an area in severity, but Helene drenched the whole southeast!",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fvrz9t,1728019990.0,Czar_hay,Georgia,"[{'Comment Author': 'Suspicious-Ranger322', 'Comment Body': 'Modern problems require modern solutions.'}]"
Richard B. Russell Scenic - post Helene? ,Hi all. I know the *Richard* B. *Russell Scenic* Highway was closed after Hurricane Helene. Is it back open yet?
