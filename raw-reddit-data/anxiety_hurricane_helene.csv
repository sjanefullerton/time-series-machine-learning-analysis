Hurricane Helene is about to hit and I'm on the verge of a panic attack.,"We are currently under a state of emergency and have never been hit by a storm of this magnitude. Tornadoes are popping up everywhere. I am terrified. I can't stop shaking. I'm alone with only my cats. I live in a very rural area and I'm worried about trees hitting my house. I feel so trapped. My chest is so tight like I can't breathe and it's not even here yet.

If you are in the path, PLEASE stay safe!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1fqckm9/hurricane_helene_is_about_to_hit_and_im_on_the/,1727400938.0,MacheteAndMeatballs,Anxiety,"[{'Comment Author': 'overcatastrophe', 'Comment Body': ""I'm sorry you are going through this.  Do you have a safe room for you and the cats?  When we get tornados here, I always put the cat in the carrier so that I don't have to worry about where he is incase the unthinkable happens.  He hates it, but its one less thing I have to worry about, know he is safer with me than hiding in a dangerous spot.\n\nI think this is one of those cases where it's going to suck for a few hours, but you gotta white knuckle your way through.  Silver lining is that you are experiencing a rational reaction to a real threat, which somehow always feels better to me than fear/panic attack with no real threat, not that that helps you right now.  \n\nI also want to say good luck, but without inflection I feel like it comes across as glib or sassy.

"Hurricane Helene aftermath, Have to be in the car for 6 hours, I am terrified¬†","Due to Hurricane Helene my family and I had to evacuate our home. We were able to find lodging an hour away, which was extremely difficult.

I had to drink 2 beers, take rescue remedy (which unfortunately did nothing), cried, began to shake, and thought I was dying during the car ride. Racing heart, shortness of breath, flight or fight like never before. It was a nightmare.

We have checked on our home and it is still without power and running water, which means we will have to relocate for another few weeks, perhaps longer.

We are now planning to go stay with relatives 6 hours away. If there was a way to avoid this drive, I would do it, but unfortunately our options are limited at the moment.

I don't know how I can manage a 6 hour car ride. It feels like an eternity. I am not an alcoholic, but drinking beer does calm my nerves in the moment, and I only use it when necessary. Like during the aftermath of a natural disaster.

Any advice how how to get through this long car drive? Should I preemptively drink? I won't be driving.

Should we leave at night or in the morning?

I almost called 911 this morning due to having a panic attack thinking about the upcoming road trip.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1g3igx2/hurricane_helene_aftermath_have_to_be_in_the_car/,1728919576.0,freepeople21,Anxiety,"[{'Comment Author': 'hiitsmeyourwife', 'Comment Body': ""I would take sleeping pills.

Anxiety Regarding Hurricane Helene ,"So, this is going to be a long one, I‚Äôm currently feeling the physical symptoms of anxiety, restlessness, muscle aches, racing thoughts, trouble sleeping, you name it. Well this is due to in part that I‚Äôm visiting my girlfriend who lives in SC and I live in California. You might be wondering where the anxiety from a hurricane is coming from if I live in California, well I‚Äôm currently visiting my girlfriend to support her since her town was hit by hurricane Helene, and even though I‚Äôm currently in charlotte NC, l am extremely anxious that another hurricane is somehow coming and it‚Äôs going to destroy everything around me and it‚Äôs going to cause me to die a horrible death. I know it‚Äôs completely absurd and it probably feels like I‚Äôm making this stuff up, but I‚Äôm being honest to god it doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm constantly looking at articles and posts that depict the carnage left behind. In addition I have plans to move to SC once I finish school and apparently they have hurricanes every year, in essence I just need reassurance and I just want to calm my racing mind and body down I apologize for the extremely long post.

Hurricane Anxiety,"Hey guys,

I live in FL and we‚Äôre getting ready to be hit by at least a Cat 3 hurricane.

I‚Äôve been through many hurricanes before, i‚Äôve lived here my entire life and Ian was the worst one i‚Äôve been through and it has given me extreme anxiety about storms and hurricanes.

I‚Äôm not scared of not having power for days or anything like that. It‚Äôs during the storm that scares me. During Ian it sounded like the roof was gonna get ripped off.

This time we‚Äôre most likely putting boards on our windows and we have generators and plenty of food and water. As far as i know we‚Äôre not in a major flood zone.

I‚Äôm just scared, more like terrified. I hate the sound of the wind and the unknown. especially seeing what happened in north FL / GA / TN and NC with helene. It‚Äôs giving me unbearable anxiety and i don‚Äôt know how to calm myself down.

Before you suggest leaving, I can‚Äôt. I live with my mom and her fianc√© and we have a very aggressive dog who hates people and other animals. We have no where to bring him, plus the surrounding states are destroyed from Helene. We‚Äôve stayed every other time and end up being fine. I just hate it.

I guess what i really need is advice or reassurance or anything to help me have some piece of mind.

I‚Äôm also starting to worry about the aftermath like with work and school. If there‚Äôs no power i‚Äôm not gonna be able to sleep AT ALL for work because i have sleeping issues already, so if im not PERFECTLY comfortable it‚Äôs almost impossible. (ik that‚Äôs a first world problem but im just spiraling right now.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1fxpnge/hurricane_anxiety/,1728245499.0,Delicious-Ground4267,Anxiety,"[{'Comment Author': 'Flimsy-Mix-190', 'Comment Body': 'I am in Florida as well but on the east side. I am sure we will feel something though as its coming almost over me as it leaves. I have also lived in Florida my entire life (Miami) and went through many storms including Andrew.   \n  \nAs long as you weren\'t told to evacuate or are in an evacuation zone, just hunker down. I know it\'s nerve wrecking and the sounds the storm make are scary but you\'ve been through this before and you just have to go through it again. It\'s okay to have a few rough nights. I also can\'t sleep unless everything is ""perfect"" but sometimes things aren\'t and we just have to pull through.'}]"
