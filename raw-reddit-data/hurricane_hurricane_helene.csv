FEMA‚Äôs Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) was running critically low, down to $3.4 billion in late summer 2023. In fact, FEMA even had to resort to delaying long-term projects to preserve funds for emergencies. The idea that FEMA is sitting on a stockpile of money is a gross misrepresentation of the truth. The increased demand due to a rising number of natural disasters, like hurricanes and wildfires, has drained FEMA‚Äôs resources faster than it can be replenished.\n\nAs for your claim that the ""other money that got spent has nothing to do with disaster relief,"" you\'re missing the point. Whether it\'s direct DRF funds or funds from other FEMA-associated programs like the Shelter and Services Program (SSP), the reality is that FEMA‚Äôs resources are being stretched thin because of immigration-related services. FEMA allocated $650 million in 2024 for immigrant services, and this diversion has had real consequences for its ability to respond to natural disasters. To ignore this fact is either willful ignorance or an intentional distraction.\n\nRegarding your criticism of Trump, you conveniently bring up his economic decisions to deflect from the actual issue at hand. Trump\'s policies, whether you agree or disagree with them, are irrelevant to FEMA‚Äôs current funding crisis. If you want to have a debate about tax policy or corporate bailouts, fine, but that‚Äôs a separate conversation. The fact remains: FEMA\'s budget is being strained because it‚Äôs prioritizing funds for programs like immigrant shelters at a time when Americans are facing unprecedented natural disasters. \n\nYou claim FEMA has delivered millions of meals and liters of water, which is great, but that doesn‚Äôt address the bigger picture. Yes, FEMA provides immediate relief, but it has had to make difficult decisions on what long-term recovery efforts it can afford to continue because of budget limitations. Even if FEMA is providing some assistance, the real question is: how much more could they do if funds weren‚Äôt being diverted to non-disaster-related programs?\n\nYour attempt to deflect blame from FEMA‚Äôs mismanagement and the broader issue of immigration-related spending doesn\'t hold water. The facts are clear: FEMA is stretched thin because funds are being allocated in ways that dilute its core mission‚Äîdisaster relief for American citizens. Whether you\'re defending the Biden administration or trying to deflect with outdated critiques of Trump, you‚Äôre missing the point entirely.'}, {'Comment Author': 'FreeIndeed87', 'Comment Body': 'Discouraging people from seeking aid?

I also appreciate using Katrina as a sort of meter stick for conveying the seriousness of this tragedy, but to do that I also think we have a critical responsibility to remember that what emerged afterward was a global humanitarian crisis.\n\nDespite quibbling over ‚Äúdirect‚Äù or ‚Äúindirect‚Äù deaths, the fact of the matter is that thousands more needless deaths and untold suffering would occur over the following two months. And that‚Äôs just the ‚Äúimmediate‚Äù response. Nearly a million people suffered tremendous abuse- at the hands of each other and of the agencies and offices meant to protect them and of fellow Americans‚Äî in ways so creative that survivors will likely never understand just how intimately that trauma has affected them. Add on that up to 50% of total *direct* deaths had been completely preventable, and it becomes a very different type of discussion. New Orleans has not been afforded an opportunity to grieve and process let alone recover, and public discussion has to consider the injustices the city faced. I‚Äôve also seen it be declared as more serious and concerning than Katrina because of whole towns being washed out‚Äî [when the actual *natural* disaster did not occur in New Orleans.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mississippi-coast-areas-wiped-out/)\n\n**Me saying this in a vacuum of course is completely unhelpful and at worst participating in the trauma Olympics myself.** But why it‚Äôs important is because we can take these lessons, and use them to help those suffering now and protect them from suffering even further. Professionals are already well on top of that. Now that we have smartphones to document true bullshit and wrongdoing, survivors can be helped instead of criminalized. Aid can now be requested more directly. Private operators really just do not give a damn, bless them, and much like the Cajun Navy before them created an Air Force to get to those the Armed Forces can‚Äôt. Not to get partisan in any particular direction, but Biden‚Äôs already done remarkably well by not saying it was totally unprecedented and being off on vacation. Roy Cooper leading at this time is honestly very, very reassuring, and hindsight is 20/20 but with how close he was to becoming the Dem running mate not getting chosen was incredibly fortuitous. Even just expressing empathy is worth so much to a group that feels so, so alone right now, and people are popping into the New Orleans sub to ask advice directly (which for the record I don‚Äôt recommend, but the overwhelming grace they‚Äôre extended is heartening‚Äî a lot of the diaspora landed in Asheville and *that* is something truly incomprehensible).

Why is Hurricane Helene so destructive?,"Obviously Helene was an extremely powerful storm, but it seems as though this has been the most destructive hurricane since Michael or even Irma/Maria, just from memory.

Was it different from a typical hurricane in any way? Were affected regions underprepared? Has disaster relief done a poor job?

I teach environmental science and sustainability to college students and have been in this field for years. We all know warm water is hurricane fuel. But the hallmark of climate change is the heavy amounts of rain and moisture that we are now seeing in the northeast and Midwest. Then, as the atmosphere continues to warm, evaporation adds moisture to the air. That is an issue because warmer air holds more water. To be precise 7% more water per 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit of warming. So, the hotter it gets above pre-industrial levels, the more moisture in the air and the more water than can fall to the ground. Now pair that with a hurricane that is pumped up on sea water that is at record temps, and not much wind sheer, and you get a super charged storm with access to a lot of moisture and an endless amount of hurricane fuel. As the planet continues to warm we are going to see these extremes getting worse. On the opposite side of the country it is the exact opposite and will also keep moving toward that extreme. We absolutely have to get away from fossil fuels so we can get things moving in the right direction. Also remember that if we cross 2 degrees Celsius and sustain we will see things get way worse than we can imagine. We have already passed the 1.5 degrees Celsius mark and sustained starting in 2023. If we don‚Äôt take this seriously it will change the whole landscape of the planet. If anything this storm should open peoples eyes to the fact that there is no hiding from climate change and our only option is to get away from fossil fuel dependence as fast as possible.'}, {'Comment Author': 'tiny_bamboo', 'Comment Body': 'It‚Äôs a repeat of the Asheville floods of 1916, except that time the hurricane after the storm came up through SC'}, {'Comment Author': 'Georgie_Girl0127', 'Comment Body': 'WNC has always been susceptible to flooding because of the river valleys with in the geography.

Should I stay or leave for hurricane helene ,"I stay in the tallahassee area for college and wanted to know if it's worth leaving because of hurricane helene. I live in a townhouse that is on the older side and I'm not sure if there would be damage to the town house. My only option is to go to atlanta if I leave which is also going to get hit by the storm so I don't know if it's is worth leaving but any advice that is offered would be appreciated.

Edit: I left to go to Atlanta due to advice from family and you guys so thank you.

I don‚Äôt know much about hurricanes so How come the recent Helene went so far inland? What‚Äôs the factors involved?,"So I live in Texas and we get hurricanes fairly often along the gulf coast. Up in  North Texas about 4-5 hours from the coast we might get some heavy rain during that time but nothing major.

I was looking at Helenes trajectory and noticed many of the areas badly hit were actually pretty far inland and was not hugging the coast like most hurricanes do, or at least that‚Äôs what I think they do.

What about Helene made it possible for it to go that deep into the coastal states? Does the Appalachian mountains influence it, or maybe the time of year? Or do hurricanes actually cause damage inland often and I just never noticed it? What about Texas‚Äôs geography make it to where a hurricane doesn‚Äôt enter that deep?",https://www.reddit.com/r/hurricane/comments/1fu7bn5/i_dont_know_much_about_hurricanes_so_how_come_the/,1727840871.0,Amockdfw89,hurricane,"[{'Comment Author': 'taylorscorpse', 'Comment Body': 'Helene moved a lot faster than most hurricanes, there was also heavy rain in southern Appalachia in previous days so there was already a lot of water in the area for Helene to add to'}, {'Comment Author': 'Dangerous_Remove6209', 'Comment Body': 'There are already answers here, but none of them mention the specific meteorological conditions that were present. \n\nJust a few days before landfall, a stationary broad upper level trough and/or cut-off low pressure system located over the lower midwest had set itself up a couple days before Helene reached peak intensity. There was also a high-pressure ridge north of the system over the southeastern United States. \n\nHigh pressure ridges act like tropical cyclone blockades. The presense of a high-pressure system over the southeastern United States limited Helene‚Äôs initial movement and caused it to move slowly, east of the Yucatan Peninsula. When this high pressure ridge began shifting east, Helene was enabled to start interacting with the aforementioned upper-level trough. Upper level troughs and general low pressure systems act like magnets for other low pressure systems, including Helene. Helene was essentially sucked north into the United States by this trough and this interaction was apparent through its movement speed, which reached up to 24 mph. That speed is impressive for a system that was located in the Gulf of Mexico. A swift movement speed of 24 mph due to upper-level low attraction as well as its quick rapid intensification over the warm waters of the Gulf allowed Helene to move further inland while retaining more strength than tropical cyclones would normally have. \n\nAlso, the geographical nature of the Appalachian mountains further eccentuated Helene‚Äôs effects and rainfall.'}, {'Comment Author': 'YourMindlessBarnacle', 'Comment Body': 'She was 90% larger than other tropical cyclones before her, and she was faster moving, so she remained intact longer.

Going that far inland is the norm, not the exception. \n\nThe only difference this time was 1) intensity & size, but most importantly 2) the two days of rainfall from the front coming southeast, from the northwest, that dropped all the rain immediately before the hurricane. \n\nNormally a hurricane coming north from the gulf will continue on inland quite far. Like we saw. There was nothing unusual about how far inland Helene went. Depending on the normal fronts coming from the NW, a hurricane will veer west or east, or even make a loop like this one did. \n\nBut normally hurricanes are less strong, and weaken very quickly once they hit land. They go just as far inland , but have weakened to tropical storms by the time they get into GA or AL. Usually by the time they reach northern GA/ AL/ LA, they are tropical storms or tropical depressions. But this time, there were hurricane warnings all the way up to metro Atlanta, which is incredibly unusual. But this all has to do with the force, not the width of the hurricane, and thus the amount of rainfall. \n\nBut by far the devastation north of Florida was mostly due to the fact that there was *so much* rain for the two days ahead of Helene.  I have never experienced that before. The ground was already saturated, and river levels already high. So they flooded. In addition to the waterways, with the ground being so incredibly saturated & mountain areas having so much slope/ elevation to the terrain, mudslides became an issue. If that front had not dumped so much rain before Helene came, there would not have been nearly as much flooding/ damage.\n\nEdit- adding this-\n\nThey are harder to find online, but when you find graphics that show the entire path of hurricanes, you see going far inland is the norm. \n\nIn this link, there is a graphic further down the page that shows the 2024 hurricanes, and you see Beryl (I think it is Beryl) made it all the way to Michigan, and Francine made it all the way to Canada\n\nhttps://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/2024-09-17-hurricane-season-falls-below-average\n\nAnd even Harvey made it to about the same spot over the mountains that Helene did\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorological_history_of_Hurricane_Harvey\n\nAnd this graphic to see a *lot* of hurricane paths\n\nhttps://www.abccolumbia.com/2022/10/10/track-historical-hurricanes-tropical-storms/\n\nWe just rarely remember their final tracks because they bring just another uneventful rainy day for most of their paths inland.'}, {'Comment Author': 'ManufacturerLeather7', 'Comment Body': 'Don‚Äôt go down this [rabbit hole](https://youtu.be/4YtOJ5W0EXg?si=L7CQUOhdfIZexmNi).'}, {'Comment Author': 'Amockdfw89', 'Comment Body': 'Thank yall for all your answers.

advice- hurricane helene,"with hurricane helene getting worse by the hour, i'm struggling with the decision on whether i need to go home. i'm in orlando for college, which although isn't explicitly supposed to get hit it easily could if the storm moves anywhere east, and we are close enough to tampa that it has me concerned. i'm from palm beach, which is only supposed to get rain and likely not be effected majorly, and am wondering if it's the right call to drive home. i'd leave tomorrow after my last class gets out (1:30) as the storm is supposed to get really bad tomorrow night. do you think it's worth it for me to go home? i'm afraid of not leaving, it getting bad, and then having missed my opportunity to leave. i'm a freshman so i wasn't in orlando for hurricane ian (we were unaffected in palm beach) so i don't have the prior experience to decide this one myself. please Imk what you guys think!! thank you so much in advance!

EDIT: thank you all SO much for the advice!! as someone with major storm anxiety it was so helpful! i have made the decision to go home and am leaving tomorrow morning. i am worried a bit about my apartment because 1)i have 2 very large windows in my bedroom (one in the closet and one that takes up most of my wall) and 2)my unit is on the first floor, but i‚Äôm really trying to think positively and hope for the best!! to anyone else who is supposed to be affected by the storm, you are in my thoughts and prayers and i am sending nothing but loads of positive energy and good luck!! thanks again guys!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/hurricane/comments/1foj4f7/advice_hurricane_helene/,1727201300.0,fromthecherrytable,hurricane,"[{'Comment Author': 'AbleBaker1962', 'Comment Body': ""Are you at UCF?\n\nAre you in dorms?\n\nIf you are, I would stay put.

It then begins to compact into ice, which is heavier and the real problem. (Want to note ice can form in many ways). Too much snow buildup on improperly built, designed, or maintained roofs results in structural damage or collapse. Case in point- you won‚Äôt see a flat topped roof for any residential building across areas prone to blizzards+snowfall. \n\nUnlike rain and storm surge, which will recede, snowfall can be cumulative (which is less destructive in some aspects), and last until the first thaws/melts in spring. Remember how I mentioned weight+compacting to ice? Applies here too.\n\nSimilar to torrential rainfalls, blizzards can leave people stranded in sudden snowfalls. Every few years a bad one hits Chicagoland, and people get trapped+freeze to death in there cars/houses along rural roads and towns (sometikes, they can bein highly populated down town areas- every decade or so one crushes downtown Chicago and strands people along the streets. The last major one occured in the early 2000s and 50 or so people died along Lake Shore Drive alone (major, well known and traversed street in Chicago.) \n\nThe weight of snow build up can snap telephone and electricity cables, and in some cases, can not be immediately repaired for multiple days. (Longest personal winter outage I ever experienced in Great Lakes area was 7days)\n\nIt‚Äôs also not just snow that is the problem. Ice storms are VERY real and not unheard of. More common, and almost as dangerous, is freezing rain. People careen into each other and other animals or objects or obstacles at alarming rates. \n\nAdditionally, blizzards are regularly tropical depression strength, usually low end cat 2/1 hurricane strength.

Hurricane Milton Evacuation amid Helene Effects,"Hurricane Milton is currently a dangerous category 4 hurricane with winds of 155mph.  Residents of the Tampa Bay Area began evacuating in earnest yesterday and it continued into the night.  Gas is hard to come by already. The other major issue is the debris from Helene.  Thousands of homes had flood damage from Helene‚Äôs storm surge and in the days since Helene made landfall residents have removed all the flood damaged property (including walls, furniture, and appliances) and threw it out on the side of the road for the city to pick up.   Normally, this would take weeks but the cities and state of Florida are working 24 hours a day up until tropical storm force winds hit to try and remove all that flood debris.  It may not ultimately matter significantly as those places could see well over 10 feet of storm surge. Helen‚Äôs winds weren‚Äôt significant in the Tampa Bay area but Milton will likely bring stronger winds on top of a more significant storm surge.  This wind driven significant storm surge will do more significant damage to homes than Helene did in the Tampa area.

"Helene forecast for major hurricane Florida landfall, track wobbles may define the cost","The reality of tracking hurricanes is that they often wobble as nearing the coast. In 2017 Hurricane Irma was forecast to make landfall in the Florida Keys east of my location which would have left me comfortably on the weaker side of the impact zone. Upon waking in the morning and looking at the radar image of Irma, I saw it was directly off shore and my house was directly in the eye‚Äôs bullseye. When the eye was near I looked out of these bullet-proof glass viewing windows built into my reinforced concrete house, and I couldn‚Äôt see more than 10/15/20 feet. During the eye I went outside to check on my house (and my neighbors house) and looking straight up I saw a patch of blue sky.",https://www.artemis.bm/news/helene-forecast-for-major-hurricane-florida-landfall-track-wobbles-may-define-the-cost/,1727390729.0,herenowjal,hurricane,[]

Evacuated for Helene but Family Refused,"I don‚Äôt know what to do honestly or how to convince my family that this hurricane is serious.

They live in the panhandle near the coastline, right near the worst part of the storm, in a little trailer and absolutely refused to evacuate. They are somehow convinced it won‚Äôt be bad even with everything telling us it will.

I evacuated with my husband and baby as we couldn‚Äôt risk anything for the baby‚Äôs sake, and we don‚Äôt even live as close as they do to the water!!

I‚Äôm so frustrated and worried. They have a bit more time to leave and just won‚Äôt. This is a nightmare. 



EDIT: Update! My family is okay! By some miracle honestly they didn‚Äôt get hit too bad and not even trees fell in their yard apparently. Just hope this doesn‚Äôt fuel them to ignore evacuations in the future!! 

And my little family is okay. We evacuated several hours away and this city just got some tiny branches down. Feel terrible for everyone affected by the storm surge.

Scared and unable to leave ,I am writing this  in advance of hurricane Milton. I want to evacuate to another state but I don't have the means to. I 32f recently had eye surgery to be able to get pass my vision test for my license. A few complications and still not able to see fully in one eye.  So I can't rent a car. Not that I have any money since my job let me go after extended leave. Family members in other states are living paycheck to paycheck so no help. The reason I am wrihting this is so if I'm swept up by a tornado or some weird as debris other people will remember me . Lame I know . The videos on tik tok are making my nerves crazy. I'm also just venting somewhere since Tampa has already been through Helen. All I can I ask for are prayers . Anyways I hope to be able to say I am fine  after the storm.  ,https://www.reddit.com/r/hurricane/comments/1fxypsz/scared_and_unable_to_leave/,1728272493.0,Cultural-Rain-9540,hurricane,"[{'Comment Author': 'Loeden', 'Comment Body': ""For Helene, Florida was covering uber rides to storm shelters.

So far we had one, back in July, which is actually the earliest in the season a category 5 hurricane has ever formed in the Atlantic Basin.\n\nI think most meteorologists would expect to see at least 1 more major (cat3‚Äî5) hurricane this season. The ACE for the season is nowhere near where meteorologists expect it to finish.\n\nWe had a very busy July, slow August and really even September, which tend to be the busiest months. I think the odds are pretty high we have at *least* one more big one before the season wraps up.\n\nHurricanes, especially strong ones have a tendency to bring down the surface temperatures from churning up cooler water from the bottom of the ocean, thus reducing the odds of subsequent strong hurricanes forming.\n\nBut if history has taught us anything is that if it happened before, it can always happen again.\n\nFrom a physics stance, sea surface temps are effectively potential energy, and the wrath of the storms is the kinetic energy.

Why isn‚Äôt South Carolina in as much turmoil as NC even though they‚Äôre closer to the coast?,Wouldn‚Äôt SC be more deviated because they got hit when Helene was stronger? I just have a bunch of questions because this is the first time I‚Äôve ever seen a hurricane deal more damage to an inland area than the costal area it made landfall in.,https://www.reddit.com/r/hurricane/comments/1fw7iti/why_isnt_south_carolina_in_as_much_turmoil_as_nc/,1728069917.0,wolfpussy69420,hurricane,"[{'Comment Author': 'stasismachine', 'Comment Body': 'NC got flooded so bad due to the topography. SC is pretty flat as it‚Äôs on the coastal plain.'}, {'Comment Author': 'SomeDumbGamer', 'Comment Body': 'No. The reason Helene was so devastating to NC is because NC has some of the highest mountains east of the Rockies (the highest actually) and so when the storm tracked inland it was spinning directly into them; forcing almost all of the water out of the storm as it rapidly cooled. All that water was dumped onto mountain slopes where it quickly turned into raging torrents and horrible floods that wiped out the many towns that sit in said valleys. \n\nSouth Carolina has a much smaller portion of the Appalachians and is mostly on the piedmont and coastal plain, so they received less rainfall and the flooding they did get wasn‚Äôt as severe.'}, {'Comment Author': 'ILS23left', 'Comment Body': 'While coastal areas are devastated during hurricanes, it‚Äôs generally the immediate coastline that is impacted. These narrow strips of land see destruction from the storm surge and high winds that cross the water, with nothing slowing them down. There is minimal land interaction, and as such, there is little reduction in the storm‚Äôs strength (depending on the shape of the coast and the direction which the hurricane makes landfall). So, a few miles within the coastline get battered pretty badly. High winds can topple trees but the cost of damage and timeframes of associated cleanups are rather small. When trees fall, it‚Äôs a pretty limited footprint of the tree that is affected. \n\nBut, the costliest damage that a hurricane brings is flooding. Coastal flooding from storm surge can be terrible; look at the coast of Alabama/Mississippi during Katrina. That flooding only extends a few miles over flat land, at most. It extends up river a few dozen miles. In the grand scheme of things, these are still small footprints compared to the total land that the hurricane travels over. \n\nMountain and river flooding, however, is not isolated to a few miles. It can cover hundreds of miles in many rivers basins simultaneously. These rivers often meet together and two major floods be come one catastrophic one. This consolidation of smaller floods into larger and larger ones leads to hundreds of square miles that are underwater, sometimes by 10-20 feet. \n\nFlood levels really depend on a combination of three factors, the amount of water the hurricane dumps, the topography of the area and how long the rain lasts. Well, in the case of Helene the water which it carried was the equivalent of 619 days of Niagara Falls flows. Imagine how much water that is. Helene moved quickly over the coast and then pretty much stopped over western NC. Most of the water ended up there. Western NC is not flat by any means. This water consolidates from all of the mountains and hills into sinks like streams, rivers, ponds and lakes. This reduces the surface area of the water considerably. But, the volume of water is not reduced, so it gets deeper. Near the coast, the land is pretty flat and the water has more surface area, which means on average it is more shallow. It also usually has an outlet and flows out to the ocean. Western NC is farther from the coast, like you said, so this water really has nowhere to go. It just gets deeper and deeper until it overflows the banks of a river or lake, causing a flash flood. Areas which usually don‚Äôt have water, now have raging waters flowing through them. This washes away anything it can, causing billions in destruction. Anything left behind is ruined by the water damage, inflating the damage costs higher. \n\nFlash floods are also very deadly compared to storm surge or high winds. Usually people have days to prepare for wind and storm surge. They can evacuate. Flash floods happen in as little as 30 seconds. A wall of water many feet high traveling at 40-50mph cannot be outrun, nor properly prepared for.\n\nFinally, western NC had already received record rainfall in the days before Helene hit. So rivers and other basins were already full. \n\nAn excellent example of such a hurricane would be Hurricane Floyd in 1999, also in NC. It made landfall near Wilmington as a major hurricane. But, by far the greatest destruction was in northeastern NC. Floyd dumped many inches of rain over the state. The river basins in the central part of the state flow eastbound to the ocean and sound. All of this water in the rivers grew deeper as it collected more and more water that was falling to the east. But suddenly, bottlenecks in the river systems cause the rivers to flood the surrounding communities. Areas of Tarboro, Kinston, Greenville and others were suddenly under many feet of water. More rain actually fell in Wilmington than anywhere else during the hurricane. But, it quickly flowed out to the ocean. To make things worse, the northeastern part of the state had just been hit by Hurricane Dennis 10 days before. The water had no where to go but up. Adding insult to injury, Hurricane Irene passed through 30 days later, dumping 10 more inches of rain, despite the fact that some areas were still underwater.'}, {'Comment Author': 'Tigolebitties23', 'Comment Body': 'I am in SC - we just got power back on yesterday.

Being told to evacuate AFTER a hurricane?,"So Helene roughed up most of Tampa with the swell. I, personally, lost a car to the swell and ended up with a 1/4"" water through 3/4 of my studio apt. No carpet, no unfinished wood. They put a commercial dehumidifier in day 1 and I let it run until I saw no water motion through the tube for 2+ hours before I turned it off to alleviate the fact that it raised my indoor temp 15 degrees (a/c died). 4 days after the storm, a notice was given to every first-floor resident of this 23-builing complex to mandatorily evacuate by day 11 after the storm. My apartment is fine, minus a/c and a now-dead fridge. But I have a 14-month contract with these people to house me. They're essentially just turning us loose. Is this even legal?

Why were TN and NC hit so hard by Helene?,"First and foremost, hoping and praying for those impacted by this storm. The uttermost respect towards those helping via rescue efforts, road reconstruction, and power line repair. 

When the news broke of Helene, there was a lot of talk regarding Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi getting hit with the horrific aspects of this storm. It appears Tennessee and North Carolina were hit ‚Äòout-of-the-blue‚Äô. I am seeing conflicting reports of the warnings being in place in time and the opposite of not enough time. 

Also, be it may that I am not in that region, when the storm was no longer as ‚Äòpowerful‚Äô as when it hit landfall, why did all the carnage in these two states occur? Was there unprecedented infrastructure failure? Was there a lack of communication? Where the gulf states simply more acclimated to hurricanes, therefore ‚Äòbetter‚Äô prepared? What is going on? 

Again, I mean this in no way to be offensive. I am simply curious how these states were hit so hard. I do not want to compare them with the directly hit states - disaster is still disaster no matter what - but I am curious. Any insight is appreciated.

So it was primed to be a disaster before the hurricane was so bad. \n\nWorth pointing out that NHC did explicitly worn of a truly terrible impact here so it wasn‚Äôt out of the blue. \n\nWell someone prevented NWS from putting TN under a tropical storm warning so TN wasn‚Äôt as warned as it could have been but WNC was warned. Just like it is unimaginable even with a warning.'}, {'Comment Author': 'Timely_Appeal7274', 'Comment Body': 'Record breaking rain levels in communities built near rivers and in valleys. The nolichucky river rose 30+ feet. Everyone wants to blame infrastructure but most of the damage was to small, almost isolated towns that had been operating on their own for generations with no problems. \n\nPrior to the hurricane, this area had about a week straight of raining, so all the humidity allowed Helene to retain strength so far inland. The rain weakened the soil and made the landslides much more prone to happening.'}, {'Comment Author': 'Swimming_Assistant76', 'Comment Body': 'I‚Äôm in a part of TN that was hit but not bad. We had flooding and road closures, but no major damage because the storm went farther east so we got spared.\xa0\n\n1) First, this wasn‚Äôt really being talked about at all. Unless you went specifically looking for news about it, a lot of people just didn‚Äôt know, and people didn‚Äôt go specifically looking for hurricane news because why would that have anything to do with us when we are landlocked and over 6 hours from the ocean?\xa0\n\nI was only paying attention because following weather is part of my work.\n\nI had to tell my father who was planning to drive through East TN and West NC on Thursday about the danger. He didn‚Äôt believe me. He just kept saying well back roads might flood, but the interstates will be fine. He genuinely thought I was overreacting that it might be dangerous in that area. Which brings me to:\n\n2) This was a boy who cried wolf situation. A lot of these areas routinely get flooding with heavy rains. You know which parts of town may flood, which roads.\xa0You think ok if it gets bad, those areas may be underwater, but the rest of town will be ok.\xa0\n\nThese types of reports about possibility of severe flooding happen all the time. You think you know what that means. You have pictures in your head of past floods, how high it came, where, etc. You can‚Äôt leave every time you get a warning. I‚Äôd never be home. It‚Äôs the same as tornado warnings. You can‚Äôt just leave every time one is forecasted. Work, school, life is not being cancelled for the weather.\xa0\n\nNo one thought floods of that magnitude with that type of damage were possible.\xa0\n\nWe get rain from hurricanes that move inland all the time. That‚Äôs nothing new. Why would we all of a sudden think massive destruction was going to happen?\xa0\n\n3) The TN / NC area is a very poor rural area for the most part. A lot of the people live at or below the poverty line. They can barely feed their families. There‚Äôs no money to prepare, stockpile, or evacuate, and they can‚Äôt afford to miss work.\xa0\n\n4) The infrastructure is not great because these are smaller, poorer, rural areas. Also, because of the water table and fooding, most of your lines and such are above ground, not below. When, you factor in you‚Äôre in the middle of a forest and add in severe wind and landslides, trees start taking everything out, and there goes all your power. You‚Äôre\xa0also on a mountain with cliffs.\xa0\n\n5) I‚Äôm not sure how true, but I have also heard it was supposed to originally hit farther west than it did, and it was only late Wednesday night into Thursday morning that people found that out. By then, it was too late. This sounds right to me as I am farther\xa0west, and we were originally told to prepare for it to hit us worse than it did.\n\nIf it had hit our area like it did the mountains, I can tell you no one would have been prepared. We were prepared for what we got which was heavy rain and some flooding that closed and damaged some roads around town. It was more severe than our normal flooding, but not the worst we‚Äôve ever seen.\xa0\n\nMost people in my area had no idea anything was even coming until Friday, and even then, work was still going on like normal, so I can‚Äôt blame these people in the East for not doing more to prepare.\xa0'}, {'Comment Author': 'T-RexLovesCookies', 'Comment Body': 'North Carolina was sending out pretty serious warnings. Asheville had 10 inches of rainfall before the hurricane ever made landfall.\n\nThere were very dire warnings sent out Thursday and they ALREADY HAD flooding at that point.\n\nThey did warn people as well as they could and they were very aware that it was going to be a catastrophe.\n\nThe only thing they could have done better would have been to suggest evacuation....but if you are in the mountains it is a lot harder to evacuate.

The Community Enhancement Project Announcement - Feedback Wanted!,"Hello r/Hurricane community!

On behalf of the moderation team, I am excited to present to everyone the [Community Enhancement Project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/192cNFYvDq4mAf-A9RMSMdD4IgHoS-4L6/view) I have been spearheading since Hurricane Helene.

Summary is below. However, I invite everyone to review the document itself as it will serve as the backdrop for implementing new rules, as soon as tomorrow if well received.

**Preface**

Hurricanes can be a source of stress/anxiety, and can unfortunately be life changing for some. Therefore, the community should be understanding of the true impact a storm can inflict on some individuals.

This document attempts to realign this community to its core objectives. In it, we try to provide better rules, clearer guidance, and new automations to provide a better experience of all.

Sub growth from 39.5K before Helene to 63.8K (as of Friday).

**Core Complaints**

1. Too many post-storm coverage
2. Too many news articles
3. Too many politics and political comments.
4. Too many trip anxiety posts
5. Too many evac questions

**Core Subreddit Objectives**

* Be a community of neutral, open-minded, and kind individuals who enjoy discussing hurricanes, tropical cyclones, and other hurricane related topics.
* Provide helpful resources for members to learn, track, prepare and stay informed about tropical cyclones without extreme biases or excessive politics.
* In the event of a destructive storm, provide assistance for those who may need resources and support before and immediately following a storm.

"The US property and casualty insurers netted $823 billion in premiums last year, posting record profits in the hottest year on record with dozens of extreme weather disasters with tolls in the billions of dollars. ","This article covers several aspects of insurance and reinsurance. What do you think?

>Just how doomed is home insurance?
Hurricanes like Milton and Helene are making it harder than ever to insure your home.

>Now even catastrophe models are starting to show their weaknesses. These simulations are typically built on historical severe weather patterns, but because average temperatures are rising, the past is no longer prologue.

>Integrating climate change into catastrophe models and then into insurance premiums is its own technical challenge.

"Science behind why Hurricane Milton will weaken before making landfall, based off projection maps I've seen? I thought that happens only after hitting land. Looking to learn, thanks!","Whenever I try to search this, I just kept getting news articles but not the science, but I am just really curious (probably just searching the wrong thing). I just thought, and thought I saw with Hurricane Helene, that the storm gets stronger and stronger and stronger as it goes through the warm waters of the Gulf, then only after it hits land does it start slowing down and weakening. But the projections I have seen for Hurricane Milton is that it should start slowing down and weakening before it hits the west coast of Florida. Last map I saw was it turning into a category 4 in the middle of the Gulf and then weakening to a category 3 before landfall (this was 1-2 days ago, I know it is even stronger now). Is this the norm for most/all hurricanes is that it actually starts to slow down and weaken before making landfall or is each storm different on when it weakens because of the different factors involved? Thanks for any insight into the science behinds these.",https://www.reddit.com/r/hurricane/comments/1fyqoqm/science_behind_why_hurricane_milton_will_weaken/,1728358379.0,-lover-of-books-,hurricane,"[{'Comment Author': 'aubman02', 'Comment Body': ""I know it has to do with the wind shear.

This is because the jet stream is a thermal phenomenon. Because of the increased temperature gradient involving the introduced cold air from the front and warm air associated with Milton and its general environment over the Gulf of Mexico, the jet stream will be more pronounced. Milton will interact with the amplified jet stream which should provide increased westerly shear against Milton, especially as it moves northward in latitude. So, the National Hurricane Center and weather models unanimously expect Milton to weaken before landfall, albeit to varying degrees. The same jet stream interaction also contributed to the broad cone of uncertainty that was shown in past cone graphics because we didn't know the exact way this would manipulate Milton's path. However, the width of the cone has lessened considerably as we have gotten closer to the time of landfall, which was also inconsistent and uncertain between models.""}, {'Comment Author': 'Hot_Net_1805', 'Comment Body': 'Wind shear, dry air, eye wall replacement, and unknown science.

Thank you for the question- The comparison between Hurricane Ian (2022) and Helene (2024) is meant to emphasize the stark differences in their impacts despite both being significant storms. \n\nHurricane Ian, as many remember, was a devastating Category 4 hurricane that caused massive damage to parts of Florida and the Caribbean, with widespread flooding and destruction. Its intensity, combined with the damage it caused, made it one of the most memorable hurricanes in recent history.\n\nIn contrast, Hurricane Helene (2024) followed a different path. While it reached a similar strength in the Atlantic, the storm‚Äôs impact was much more limited in terms of human and infrastructural damage.  Hurricane Helene (2024) left significant damage across multiple states, including Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Tennessee.\n\n- **Florida**: The storm made landfall in the Big Bend region as a Category 4 hurricane, with winds reaching 140 mph. Areas like **Steinhatchee** experienced 8-10 feet of storm surge, causing mobile homes to be displaced. Coastal towns such as **Treasure Island** saw boats grounded in front yards, and widespread flooding impacted communities like **South Pasadena**. Over 4 million homes and businesses lost power in the state.\n\n- **Georgia**: As Helene moved inland, it weakened to a tropical storm but still caused significant flooding, especially in **Valdosta**, where the damage was described as resembling ‚Äúa bomb went off.‚Äù Approximately 17 people died in Georgia, and the state‚Äôs infrastructure saw considerable impacts.\nHurricane Helene floods Florida and moves north towards Georgia and the Carolinas.\n\n- **South Carolina & North Carolina**: Both states faced life-threatening floods. In North Carolina, mountain towns like **Asheville**, **Boone**, and **Rocky Mount** were particularly hard hit by floodwaters. Several towns were left in ruins, with entire homes and buildings washed away.\n\n- **Tennessee**: The storm‚Äôs path also impacted areas in Tennessee, where dam failures were imminent in some regions. Torrential rain caused severe flooding, and search and rescue operations were still ongoing in certain parts of the state.\n\nOverall, the hurricane caused at least 52 deaths and resulted in billions of dollars in damage across the Southeast.\n\nBy posting these photos it highlights the unpredictable nature of hurricanes‚Äîwhere two storms of similar strength on paper can have drastically different outcomes.\n\nHope that gives some context!'}, {'Comment Author': 'Rare_Entertainment', 'Comment Body': 'Posting random, unlabeled pictures from some other storm with no context or explanation doesn\'t really highlight anything, nor is it a comparison.

Some areas in Florida are still inaccessible and they can\'t assess the damages until it\'s safe to open the roads. We also don\'t have any idea yet about the extent of damages around Tampa Bay, and along the gulf coast. So many flooded communities that are not on the news. \n\nRegardless, I think it\'s always been quite obvious to anyone with half a brain that the extent of a hurricane\'s damages will depend on where it hits, the area\'s population density, geographical characteristics, and many other variables unique to each storm.

"Post-Milton damage in Hillsborough County, FL","Pics 1-3 are on Davis Island, which is in Zone A, sent to me by my mother. Pics 4-8 are taken on the USF campus. Pics 9-10 were sent to me by my husband near his job.

I live close to the USF area, and I‚Äôve lived in Tampa for 10 years now and this was the worst hurricane I‚Äôve seen, the only other one that was close was Irma and maybe even Helene a couple of weeks ago as well. Last night the wind was so strong that it was pushing cars around in the parking lot of my apartment building, and the sky kept flashing green from transformers blowing out.

This morning the weather was nice but I heard emergency service sirens driving by about every 10 minutes, given we had no emergency services during the storm. We have no electricity and we still have water but the water pressure is very low, and we received an alert from Hillsborough county to limit water usage as much as possible. There‚Äôs a lot of flooding and road closures, and a lot of debris everywhere and fallen trees. So many road and business signs are knocked down. A lot of traffic lights are out so driving is chaotic.

Preparing and Evacuating for Storm #3 in the last 2 years.  - Part 1 of 2,"I live in Western Charlotte county and been ordered to evacuate twice now for named storms and voluntarily leaving once last year . I‚Äôm exhausted by the incredible effort, coordination, costs, storm preparations, communication with loved ones and/or your employer, packing, planning, and even more storm preparation.  That‚Äôs just to get OUT of town.  

In the upcoming days, (best case scenario) after of living out of a suitcase  in a hotel room, you get to pack everything up, drive home and then sort out all that was taken to the evacuation route.  

Home has days of putting back everything you brought to get through  a week at a hotel/Airbnb.  Laundry, hurricane snacks, toys for the kids.  Putting back the furniture and/or flying projectiles that were JUST managed a few days report.  Lost electricity?  Replace all your food including condiments to avoid food poisoning.  didn‚Äôt loose electric (verified with the FPL app) food is still edible but a Publix run is needed to fill any gaps.  Yea, more stuff to do.  

Our entire life for the past 7 days has been dedicated and focused on Hurricane Hilton.  I haven‚Äôt had the ability or the opportunity to think of anything else since last Saturday.  I‚Äôm exhausted mentally, I hurt physically and financially depleted from this unplanned family vacation.  I‚Äôm exhausted with the overwhelming sadness when I return home and see my community destroyed yet again.  I‚Äôm completely exhausted by making plans and coordinating a place to stay in a moments notice and then controlling the chaos of family travel by answering 9284749284783 questions about what we‚Äôre doing to protect our family and also keep them alive.  I‚Äôm so freaking tired of spending money on a week I don‚Äôt want to and can‚Äôt really afford to take.  I‚Äôm overwhelmed by the amount of time I‚Äôve lost and the mountain of work that I need to catch up on.  

Every single square inch of Charlotte County, FL has been decimated in the past two years at least once.  Ian, Helene and Milton all made landfall with our neighbors, they‚Äôre just as decimated as we are/have been.  In fact, everywhere within a comfortable driving distance from work has been beat to shit, we could‚Äôt have avoided this even if we didn‚Äôt live in a Gulf of Mexico coastal town.  Tampa, Bradenton, Sarasota, Nokomis, Venice, North Port, Port Charlotte, Englewood, Boca Grande, Punta Gorda, Fort Myers, Cape Coral, Naples, and Marco Island have all been absolutely destroyed in different storms since 2022.   Some more than once.  The barrier islands have been all but taken back by the ocean at this point.   Every island between Fort Myers Beach north to Tampa and Pinellas have up to 4 feet (FEET) of sand on the island infrastructure and in the homes/condos/businesses that have been built.   Google Boca Grande and Manasota Key hurricanes 2024 to see for yourself, it‚Äôs really hard to describe the mess of these places. 
 has reported from Charlotte Harbor 3 times within the past 2 years!!!  For Milton, he chose to be here in Charlotte Herbor to document the storm surge instead of Tampa or Sarasota where they received their first hurricane which was a CAT 5 (!!!!!!). 

We can blame it on climate change, we can blame it on politicians, we can blame it on Jim Cantore.  Unfortunately, those people we blame are unable and incapable of stopping or predicting the severe and catastrophic weather.  Floridians can‚Äôt stop it, I assure we would have after 2004s season.   

Get on that soapbox you‚Äôve got ready to shame me and/ or my community for whatever decision we made to deserve this.  I hope the heartbreak and loss we have and are experiencing never even ever happens to you or someone you love.  I wouldn‚Äôt want you to understand or empathize with me, no one deserves to live through a major disaster over and over, even you.

Hurricane aftermath/ prevention for next one,"Hi everyone,

My parents live in Sarasota, FL and were devastated by the hurricane. They lost their entire first floor to 5ft of water including all pictures, memories, cars, furniture, etc but the most important part is that they are ok and managed to get out. This their first time experiencing a florida hurricane and were obviously not expecting to be hit by this magnitude.

With the threat of more storms coming not only in the upcoming weeks but in years to come, how can they/ we better prepare their home to prevent this loss from happening again??

They have to gut the enite first floor including walls, floors, complete kitchen demolition.

Does anyone have any tips and tricks to lessen the blow?? I have seen a few good ideas on google and tiktok including getting a rental moving truck and putting as much as you can and leaving (which is a great idea to save some furniture and items) but is there a better way to protect the home itself?

Thank you in advanced and praying for all impacted by hurricane Helene <3

Timing of Milton's landfall and corresponding tides ,"Some of you may have been aware of perhaps one of the only silver linings (if there is such a thing) of Helene's landfall is that it occured at the lowest possible tide (-0.1 to -0.3 ft). If it occured at high tide the coastal flooding and inundation would have been far worse.  

However, if the current landfall estimate holds true, Milton will reach the coast with a tide of +2.4 ft (assuming the projected 1 am Thursday landfall pans out). The tide will continue to rise to a peak +3 ft at 6:11 am.   If the storm arrives early, let's say 10 pm Wednesday, the tide will still be at +2.1 ft

For reference, the low tide for the day (-0.4 ft) occurs at 2:27 pm, Wednesday. 

So from a tidal standpoint, best case Milton arrives early afternoon instead of later in the evening. An additional 2-3+ ft of storm surge that has nothing to do with the power of the hurricane will inevitably cause far more damage and bring the water much further inland.  Timing of landfall will make a huge difference on the overall impact.

Rain potential of hurricanes,"We have normally been concerned about the wind speed of hurricanes. However, in recent years, hurricanes have picked up more water and delivered more rain than in the past. Now, a major threat of hurricanes is not just the wind but also the rain and flooding. That was particularly the case with Helene and western North Carolina.

We have the categories of hurricanes based on their wind speed. Is there any scale or measure of the relative amount of moisture or rainfall from a hurricane? There should be. Even a hurricane that, based on wind speed, is considered ""minor"" or ""category 1"" can do quite a bit of damage due to flooding because of rain.",https://www.reddit.com/r/hurricane/comments/1fzrtuz/rain_potential_of_hurricanes/,1728481700.0,JohnAS0420,hurricane,"[{'Comment Author': 'Thepoliceinabottle', 'Comment Body': 'It really depends on how quickly the system moves through the area as well.'}, {'Comment Author': 'dearyvette', 'Comment Body': 'We have always been concerned with both hurricane wind AND rains. This is not a new concept, at all, if you live in a hurricane-prone area.\n\nThe saturation of the ground always affects flooding. It always affects the ability of large trees to stay rooted in high winds. When the ground is supersaturated, it fails to drain. When the soil is moist down to a certain depth, tree roots loosen and large trees fall over, onto houses and cars and roads, with sheets of ground still attached to the roots.\n\nHurricanes always bring some volume of rainfall. In coastal areas, that volume is added on top of storm surge. We always pay attention to these numbers. The ground can only tolerate X amount of water being dropped or pulled ashore, over X amount of time.\n\nEvery single hurricane is forecasted with a wind map and concurrent rainfall map, for these reasons.'}, {'Comment Author': 'Drizzho', 'Comment Body': 'The reason why North Carolina was so flooded was mountains and rivers.

First of all, there\'s a lot of fear-mongering right now going on because some people are seeing GFS model runs that point to another storm developing and hitting a similar area. While this is certainly possible, the likelihood of such a scenario so far out is dubious at best. Pay attention to your local forecasters, and when there\'s a reason to sound the alarm bells, they will do so. At the moment, it is important to remember that we are still in hurricane season, and the gulf of mexico is always a place where hurricanes can and will develop.   \n  \nThe phenomenon you\'re referring to is called ""upwelling"" which refers to the forcing of colder ocean waters from far below the surface by a weather system that causes sufficient wave action to bring that colder water from the depths. While this is indeed accurate that there are colder waters present along the immediate path of the hurricane, this does not last long, and it does not mean that a hurricane cannot develop. There is still the possibility of rapid intensification, and sea surface temperatures are not the only factor that can cause this.

The dilemma of reporting the facts as it is or stretching it to warn more people,"Hurricane Helene is the 2nd landfall in a row (previously Francine) where the NHC has overreached it's landfall intensity with no support of recon data or surface observations. The data points to it being a Cat 3 at landfall.  This is not the opinion of some ""random redditor"". I'm a degreed meteorologist. Other meteorologists or experienced chasers who went through the core also shares a similar sentiment.

**Tony Brite (Former NHC & NWS Meteorologist):** *""It‚Äôs highly likely that* [*Helene*](https://x.com/hashtag/Helene?src=hashtag_click) *had weakened just prior to landfall and was no longer a Cat 4* [*#hurricane*](https://x.com/hashtag/hurricane?src=hashtag_click) *at that time.  Even so, that in no way minimizes the severity of this historic and truly devastating/catastrophic event for so many across the Gulf Coast and Southeast States of the U.S. It will simply be an unbiased review of all available ‚Äúobjective‚Äù meteorological data‚Ä¶confined to determining the best estimate of the maximum sustained wind (MSW) Helene possessed when it crossed the shoreline at 11:10 pm on 9/26/2024. I had decided to do ground ‚Äúreconnaissance‚Äù of the northeast, east, and southeast quadrants of the eyewall to observe the absolute peak wind along hwy 19 (less than 10 n mi inland from the immediate coast)‚Ä¶and those wind speeds certainly didn‚Äôt come close to supporting what a fast-moving Cat 4 should‚Äôve produced at those locations.""*

**Josh Morgerman** (been through 17 Cat 4+ TC): ""*(Helene) didn't feel like a Cat 4 to me. There's always friction over land, but there shouldn't have been that much. Perry is only \~13 mi inland over swampy terrain. I think maybe the system wasn't efficiently mixing the high winds down to the surface""*

**Jordan Hall**:¬†*""If we forecast a hurricane regardless of 1-5 and the conditions DO NOT VERIFY at that intensity I think that should be communicated to the public. Because we are going to run into an issue soon where we actually do get a Category 4+ that verifies at ground level and people are going to think (I survived a 4 already and it wasn‚Äôt that bad, I‚Äôm not leaving) and end up getting seriously hurt or worse""*

I get that the NHC is trying to warn people and it probably was beneficial in this particular instance. However, I believe that over reporting the landfall intensity will backfire and make people more hesitant to evacuate next time when the conditions don't verify. For instance, The Tallahassee residents I talked to this past week weren't taking the storm seriously because they already experienced ""Cat 4 Idalia"" from last year. What if next week a Cat 4 hits Tallahassee and no one evacuates because everyone thought they survived two Cat 4s already. That's a recipe for disaster.

I personally believe that facts should be reported as it is. If a Cat 3 Hurricane caused this much damage in the Carolina's, then maybe people will start taking it seriously when a legitimate Cat 4 hits.",https://www.reddit.com/r/hurricane/comments/1fse4fi/the_dilemma_of_reporting_the_facts_as_it_is_or/,1727642229.0,KevinLuWX,hurricane,"[{'Comment Author': 'gay4molemannn', 'Comment Body': 'I‚Äôve always wondered this. \n\nWhen they take the wind readings it‚Äôs thousands of feet in the air in the storm\n\nAre the winds slower at ground level?'}, {'Comment Author': 'QuillTheQueer', 'Comment Body': ""I'm kind of baffled by this post""}, {'Comment Author': 'KevinLuWX', 'Comment Body': ""They use stepped frequency microwave radiometer to measure surface winds from the air.

2020 HMON Implementation Science Briefing (slides),"A technical document outlining the HMON forecasting system's current (-ish, 2020) capabilities. There have almost certainly been additional forecasting improvements since then, but many of the models being included in the spaghetti charts are much older than that.

Highlights:

* The errors for its verification runs against Dorian & Florence are about 10 knots (11.5 mph) off in speed 12h prior to impact, and about 20 nautical miles (23 miles) away (again at 12 hours)
* Its errors seem relatively unbiased, when compared against the 2018-2019 hurricane season. While it may be a bit off from predicted location, it does not particularly tend towards one direction or another, and its average estimate is very accurate. It's a coin flip. 
* The simulation runs in ~100 minutes on a 43 node computer cluster. This is not particularly large in the realm of large computer clusters. Given the importance one hour of lead time can potentially make, more hardware funding for the NOAA could potentially have some real benefits for faster insights. They mention the forecast for Theia in 2016 ran in realtime: My outsider opinion is that it's worth seeing if that can be doubled.
* Also as an outsider, the highest resolution of the interior of the model (for the eye and highest intensity areas) is 2km, which seems low. The hurricane is traveling at ~20mph (32 km\h), so that's an area the hurricane spends about 4 minutes to traverse. I would suspect the finer effects of the ocean turbulence are extremely important at even smaller scales, especially around the eye. I would like to see them given the budget to conduct experiments with even higher resolution simulations.

We need more accurate hurricane predictions, as a matter of safety and national security. We must prevent another ""Helene hitting Ashville"" predictive miss.

"2024 hypothetical Atlantic hurricane season (Hypothetical post July 3rd, 2024)","Notes:

(All wind speeds are in knots with mph in brackets)

-Most majors in 1 season. (Due to record breaking SST's and low wind shear, conditions were extremely conducive to rapid intensification)

-Beryl Upgraded to 150kt 930mb in post-season analysis after further examination of recon data.

-Rafael became strongest hurricane in the NATL Basin in terms of windspeed and pressure, peaking at 180Kts \~4 hours before landfall.

-Rafael became strongest tropical system to ever make landfall, making landfall 7 miles SSE of Naples, FL at 170kt 885mb. It did this just 4 hours after it's peak intensity of 180Kt's. It weakened slightly due to initiating an eyewall replacement cycle. Rafael made landfall in it's EWRC's early stages.

-Isaac continues 'I' curse, scraping the east coast as a Cat 5. Isaac became the northernmost cat 5, weakening from 140kt to 135kt about 250 miles ENE of Wilmington Nc. It made a devastating high-end cat 3 equivalent landfall on southern nova scotia at 110kt 941mb

-Tony was a short lived low end cat 5 that, due to being trapped by a ridge, grinded to a halt in the Caribbean and killed itself off due to being stationary for 18 hours. This saved Cuba from being struck by a major hurricane. However, flooding caused severe destruction due to the outer region of it's CDO being located over it's west the entire time.

In summary, this hypothetical 2024 North Atlantic Hurricane Season saw:

-25 Tropical Depressions

-24 Tropical Storms

-15 Hurricanes

-9 Major Hurricanes
