Here is what I found. I think some of this information applies to other scheduled drugs but I am not 100% sure about that. I tried to post this on the main Resources thread but the whole comment would not post, so I made a post (link below). I am not a medical professional- this is just the information I have compiled so far. If this information is incorrect or should be updated, **please** reach out and I will make edits.\n\nAdditional sources/info in the post\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/asheville/comments/1fvz2gg/accessing\\_schedule\\_ii\\_prescription\\_meds\\_during/](https://www.reddit.com/r/asheville/comments/1fvz2gg/accessing_schedule_ii_prescription_meds_during/)\n\n**TLDR (to the best of my ability):**\n\n* You need a valid prescription for scheduled substances. Unlike other medications, you cannot just show up at an emergency pharmacy and get a refill\n* If you are unable to get in touch with your provider and need a prescription, the easiest thing (for insurance reasons) is to go to an urgent care and have the provider prescribe an emergency refill. Bring an old prescription bottle, information from your patient portal (if accessible- take screenshots if you can just in case), and any other documentation you can that is relevant to your prescription\n* If a pharmacy has your prescription but that pharmacy is not operational, one of the operational emergency pharmacies SHOULD be able to transfer your prescription. Not all of the pharmacies dispense controlled substances- call and check first\n* It may be possible to pick up your scheduled meds early but you might get a smaller amount than usual\n* Controlled substances must be picked up by the person they are prescribed to. Bring your ID (as usual)\n* Normally, scheduled substances require an electronic prescription but because of Helene that might not be possible. Paper prescriptions ARE ALLOWED under the circumstances.\n* If for some reason your doctor is unable to write you a paper or electronic prescription, but they can call the pharmacy on the phone, the pharmacy can fill your prescription if they can reasonably verify that your doctor is actually a doctor who can prescribe medication\n* Call the emergency pharmacies to check if they have your prescription in stock before you transfer your prescription\n\n**SUBOXONE INFORMATION**\n\n* MAT (suboxone) can be filled through Walgreens. EMS was on a call with them this morning and it has been verified that a previous bottle is enough for a bridge Rx. Not all locations have power or may not have recieved the update.\n* Folks who are withdrawing from Suboxone or want to start a sub Rx for any reason should reach out to the Buncombe County Community Paramedics at 828-772-1294'}, {'Comment Author': 'HappyZappyz', 'Comment Body': 'https://preview.redd.it/oh56o2cfgrsd1.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=291f201ee0bd1359bc7a80775fce55d0d74fd202\n\nSurvivors are still being found.'}, {'Comment Author': 'CertainBig9548', 'Comment Body': 'Asheville YMCA - SATURDAY, 10/5 at 11:00 a.m.-2 p.m. The [YMCA of Greater Boston](https://www.facebook.com/YMCABoston?__cft__[0]=AZXDET2iItYJEr5phzU2FCEGnAzhOC3Lzq7GjWK4ALCPyuLphRqTnM9i5mT45DEY4nXWE_9yr5gS64YpPL5EhE-A8kXRDOj8qS9KxTqr1GjnF2WVPCnWGEhbOloadUlWTOr7CBu1Noo41excs457J4w2YDNiVSC-f3595f4G5nvbD463dBixsJ68d-dv10Mibb_rRTtu0Ylu8F_EE26n4eM4phTimkraTdq-DnVfb8CY_g&__tn__=-]K-y-R)  is on their way with food and supplies making it possible to host a special pop-up Mobile Market at the[ Asheville YMC](https://www.facebook.com/AshevilleY?__cft__[0]=AZXDET2iItYJEr5phzU2FCEGnAzhOC3Lzq7GjWK4ALCPyuLphRqTnM9i5mT45DEY4nXWE_9yr5gS64YpPL5EhE-A8kXRDOj8qS9KxTqr1GjnF2WVPCnWGEhbOloadUlWTOr7CBu1Noo41excs457J4w2YDNiVSC-f3595f4G5nvbD463dBixsJ68d-dv10Mibb_rRTtu0Ylu8F_EE26n4eM4phTimkraTdq-DnVfb8CY_g&__tn__=-]K-y-R)A, 30 Woodfin Street in Downtown Asheville.

Thought I'd share the same resources on its own thread for broader attention.\n\nI want to be very clear about this: Asking for and receiving support when struggling is the strongest thing you can do. Holding onto trauma is truly never the answer. Rebuilding your life after catastrophe is not just your home or business, it‚Äôs your nervous system too. The physical, interpersonal, intergenerational manifestations of that burden is not worth it. You are worth healing, safety, care.\n\nSTART HERE:\n\nFirst: Here is a link to a Google spreadsheet with HUNDREDS of therapist in and out of state giving pro bono in-person and virtual sessions. We are all motivated to help and are on it for a reason.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XP77E1QEV43vMklyS8fjZ5PnfKR-8Mx4hY50aT417Zk/edit\n\nMost will probably do 6-8 sessions to help you with the immediate stuff and can refer you to a longer term therapist. Modalities based in processing trauma through the body are a good idea -- EMDR is a speciality of mine that is incredibly effective.\n\nSecond: Sifting and emailing a bunch of therapists is a big mental load, especially when you‚Äôre already in grief/survival mode.\n\nAsk someone, especially a person not experiencing the same, to do this for you. Send them this link and a screenshot of this message.\nNot required but helpful - share your details (gender, age, tele health/in person). Your initial request does not need to include many details, that‚Äôs what sessions are for and we know what to expect.\nOFFLOAD THIS TASK so you are not overwhelmed by emailing back and forth. Once initial contact is made with a therapist that can take you, share your email and phone so the therapist can connect directly and schedule with you.\nThird: If #2 is not possible, here are a few practices that you can email directly and ask for a pro bono clinician. Bypass the spreadsheet overwhelm and connect to a practice that has a few clinicians available rather than putting you effort into individual therapists. Purely a numbers game.\n\nThese practices take pro bono WNC folks with links direct to intake forms:\n\nCreasman Counseling\xa0https://creasman-counseling.com/reduced-fee-services/\nMiracles Counseling Centers\xa0https://www.valant.io/prospectivepatient/MiraclesHealingCenters\nValid Love Therapy Collective\xa0https://www.validlove.com/contact\nSun Counseling and Wellness\xa0https://suncounselingandwellness.com/new-clients/\nAsheville was once my home and WNC continues to be a special place for me and others.

The county is working with a contractor to pick up all storm debris on DOT, municipal and private roads. This process started on Oct. 2. The county is partnering with the municipalities within the county for this pickup service as well.\n\nStorm debris that is pushed to the right of way of a property will be picked up. Please be patient. Debris will be up picked by us as soon as possible. Residents will need to place all items along the road right of way in order for pickup.\n\nStorm debris includes tree branches, leaves, logs, building materials, furniture, paint, etc. The graphic below shows how to properly separate trash to expedite the debris removal process.\n\nThere is no need to take storm debris to the Transfer Station.

This means during your evacuation or staying at home during the disaster‚ÄîGas, Medication, Food, Shelter including staying with friends, family or in a hotel. If this is true, say ‚ÄúYES‚Äù to this question. That will result in your receiving $750 in Displacement / Critical Needs Assistance in 2-3 days if you enter direct deposit.\n2. When asked if your home is/was accessible, answer ‚ÄúNO‚Äù if there was road blockage, flooding, loss of power, damage or destruction. This will trigger funding to pay for hotels.\n3. When asked if utilities are out, say ‚ÄúYES‚Äù even if it was just for a few days. This triggers assistance $ to stay somewhere other than your home or to buy fuel to power a generator.\n4. When asked ‚ÄúAre you willing to relocate‚Äù say ‚ÄúYES‚Äù if you cannot live in your home due to damage, loss of power, etc. It is not asking if you are willing to move away from your home permanently but funds temporary hotel stays.\n5. If you bought or buy a generator, FEMA will reimburse you up to $629, but you must submit the receipt. If you bought a chainsaw, FEMA will reimburse you up to $219. Again, you need to provide the receipt.

Consider cutting off the water to your icemaker, toilet, and water heater until you feel confident the water you‚Äôre getting is mostly clear and not dirty with sediment)*\nBecause the North Fork Water Treatment Plant is not able to be used at the time, plans are to begin pressurizing the distribution system directly from reservoir water instead of going through the treatment plant.\n\nAreas are being restored incrementally; the process currently includes moving west from North Fork to Asheville. Crews are pressurizing, moving lines, and making repairs as their appear starting in Swannanoa. Once crews move past Swannanoa, the process for water restoration will hopefully be easier and faster.\n\nImportant Water Safety\nWhen water becomes available it is important to note it will have more sediment than usual. Turn off icemakers and cut off water from toilets while not in use.\nIf you have water from the City of Asheville, you are under a boil water notice. You must boil this water vigorously for at least one minute before you can use it for consumption, such as cooking, brushing teeth, and drinking. It is safe to use this water for showers, however and avoid getting water in the mouth. Sponge baths may be more appropriate for babies and small children.\nIf you get water that looks dirty, close the valve to your hot water heater to prevent sediment from accumulating.\nIf you begin receiving water that looks dirty, shut the power off to your water heater to prevent sediment from accumulating. When clean water is restored, you can turn this back on.\nIf you do not have water, turn your water heater off to prevent a fire from occurring. You can turn this back on when clean water is restored.\nSome Town of Black Mountain residents have begun receiving water. If you have water in the Town of Black Mountain, do not drink it or give it to pets. Even if you boil it, it is not safe to consume. Only use it to flush your toilet.'}, {'Comment Author': 'GreenlyCrow', 'Comment Body': ""appreciate it! and thanks for explaining so I know why it's not necessary, that was v helpful \\^\\^""}, {'Comment Author': 'Efficient-Year-8520', 'Comment Body': 'Holy cow, just called and requested to change it to ""No, due to a disaster"".

In those instances, disaster not only should be politicized, but must be politicized. Naomi Klein's work on disaster capitalism is essential reading on this particular topic. In other instances, politicization of a disaster is obstructive rat-fuckery. From where I sit this happens to be a little from each column, and in both columns the villain is of course the Republicans.\n\nThe first disaster i recall being truly, overwhelmingly politicized was Katrina. What a doozy of a disaster that was. The things that went on there are so unspeakably bad that many people understandably relegate them to the realm of conspiracy theory. The government abandoned that flooded city. Walled it off from the outside world and refused to let anyone in or out. People died like dogs in the street, drowned, starved, dehydrated and overheated. Right wing vigilantes hunted people down in the name of peace keeping and anti-looting. Police disappeared people on their lists of troublemakers and declared them lost to the flood. Many of whom were of course gang leaders and other unsavory problem makers, but still totally uncivilized behavior for a government sponsored agency bound by law. To this day many people swear they witnessed the levee protecting the Lower Ninth Ward being deliberately detonated to protect the upscale neighborhoods that would otherwise have flooded instead. The radical left stepped in and built one of the most celebrated mutual aid organizations from scratch in the immediate aftermath, inspiring millions and providing a stark contrast to government failures, and for years after they brought attention to the predation of land speculators on the Lower Ninth, as the traditional residents were driven out to make room for a new class of homeowner. I witnessed a little of this first hand and have loads of second hand accounts to back up all of this. Don't ask me to elaborate, but to the best of my knowledge it's all true.\n\nNext up was Maria. Again, a former colony populated with poor black and indigenous people was devastated, made worse by systematic underservicing of the electrical grid by a private company, and untold numbers died of preventable causes when food, clean water, and hospitals were unavailable for days to weeks. The left was outraged. The right was thrilled by a photo op with paper towels.\n\nAs usual, the right has no creativity of its own, but learns quickly from the left and once they learn they throw overwhelming amounts of money at mimicking the criticisms leveraged against them, and reflecting them back. Monkey see, monkey do. It's bullshit, but it muddies the waters so thoroughly it becomes impossible for most to see the truth clearly.\n\nAnd thus, we arrive here. A FEMA deliberately defunded by a congress hellbent on causing chaos and dissent. A state government deliberately interfering by refusing to invoke the necessary governmental responses in a timely manner, a move I first encountered last summer when the governor of Oklahoma was entirely absent following a derecho and the lieutenant governor simply didn't declare a disaster, with no explanation. And the party responsible for those choices leaning all-in on criticism of the Democratic administration that is actually attempting to manage the situation.\n\nThe Fox News style politicization of this disaster is a disgusting travesty. Disaster capitalism at its worst - interference and exploitation of disaster to achieve political and economic ends that run counter to the common good. Thwarting of rescue efforts as a way to delegitimize their opponents, frankly a form of treason, followed by capitalization on the destruction for land grabs and corrupt rebuilding contracts.\n\nTherefore, we must in turn politicize the hell out of it ourselves. Not in the way that interferes with the work of rescuers doing their damndest, blocks money and resources from making their ways to the disaster zone, forces leadership to address bullshit when they should focus on the work of rescue and rebuilding. But in a way that helps us to understand what is happening.  What is being done to our society. Today it's North Carolina. Next year it'll be somewhere else, and somewhere else, and somewhere else, until we say enough is enough.""}, {'Comment Author': '88ToyotaSR5', 'Comment Body': ""I didn't use hate speech.

You do not have to sign up for this. It‚Äôs state wide. If you sign up for Ballot Trax, you get a text when they mail your ballot so you know to look for it.\n\nYou can mail it back or drop it off at any one of a number of convenient, secure drop boxes.\n\nIf you signed up for alerts, they will text you when your ballot is received, and again when your signature is verified and your vote has been counted. If there are any issues, you can go in person and correct them.\n\nThis is what it looks like when your state believes in Democracy and wants voting to be accessible.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/spjye22dl0ud1.jpeg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d8661cab83525a816b8d822ace7fd2763e3b7e76'}, {'Comment Author': 'IShouldBWorkin', 'Comment Body': 'Total animals, lower than dirt'}, {'Comment Author': 'mymar101', 'Comment Body': 'Remember they don‚Äôt care about you or your problems'}, {'Comment Author': 'Accomplished_Sci', 'Comment Body': 'They want as few people voting as possible.

Reach out to your landlord and start a conversation. Approaching it from a ""let\'s figure out a good solution together"" is going to get you MUCH further than just stopping payment (which I don\'t think you\'d intended to do anyways). Keep in mind that eviction is a *legal* process that requires specific steps. The landlord has to present their eviction case to a court, who has to agree and issue an order to evict, and then the local Sheriff\'s office has to actually perform/oversee the eviction. The apartment company cannot, in most cases, simply change the locks or move your stuff out (not legally, at least). \n\n2. Gather your copy of the original lease and speak privately with an attorney. There are several free legal resources set up in the city right now you could also use. If you\'ve paid the October rent, you have some time to research. You\'re looking to see what your legal options are, and if/when the contract is impacted by lack of utilities, livability, etc. \n\nBasically, you have at least 21 days (since you paid October\'s rent) but possibly a bit longer (due to #1 and the current lack of availability of courts and Sheriff resources) in which to try to either come to an agreement with your landlord or identify the legal process you should use to move out. \n\nThat\'s all assuming that your goal is to do so with little-to-no impact to your credit rating, etc, which I\'m also assuming you want to do.'}, {'Comment Author': 'DruVatier', 'Comment Body': ""To my knowledge, the city has not made any official statements regarding potable vs non-potable water. \n\nHOWEVER\n\nA city's water distribution system is designed to deliver potable water.

Please Stop Spreading Misinformation About the Governments Rescue Efforts. ,"STOP SPREADING MISINFORMATION

Challenge misinformation online wherever you see it. Be a calm voice of reason. State facts. Try not to get too heated. This kind of rhetoric is dangerous.


**1. Don‚Äôt evacuate because the government is going to steal your land to mine lithium!**

That‚Äôs not a thing. Hypothetically, if the government DID want your land (they don‚Äôt), they wouldn't need all these layers of conspiracy to take it. They can invoke eminent domain and must compensate you for the property. This is basic constitutional law (5th amendment). Again, that isn't happening. Anyone telling folks not to evacuate doesn‚Äôt have their best interests at heart.

**2. FEMA is confiscating/destroying/hoarding supplies and turning away help.**

They‚Äôre telling people where to drop off supplies and asking untrained individuals not to self deploy. Going out there alone without training or equipment makes you a liability no matter how good your intentions are.

**3. The government isn‚Äôt helping!**

The government is helping. They have been since day 1. The best trained rescue technicians in the nation are working around the clock. National Guard is there. 82nd Airborne is there. Air Force & Civil Air Patrol. NC Highway Patrol. FEMA. All the politicians have come and gone. The reason why it‚Äôs taking so long to reach those in need is because this is a MASSIVE disaster spanning hundreds of miles, several states, and millions of people. So far, this is the 3rd largest mobilization of federal resources behind 9/11 and Katrina.

**4. We need to rise up against FEMA!**

Why would anyone want to harm the people who are helping? Why would anyone advocate for any act that would disrupt search and rescue operations? FEMA is not our enemy and never has been. They're average folks just like us who genuinely want to help others.

**5. Fort Liberty is being told to stand down. They're denying soldiers leave**

82nd Airborne has been deployed to WNC. Soldiers were likely told they could not use personal leave to self deploy. Considering the situation in the Middle East, they're probably not granting personal leave at all right now. This is common sense.

**6. Federal officials ordered Chimney Rock to be bulldozed**

Never happened. [Debunked by the town]
https://www.wcnc.com/article/weather/hurricane/helene/chimney-rock-bulldozed-helene/275-54741b10-7482-4116-ac38-98bff585b6e6

Let‚Äôs not forget that the agencies are managed and operated by humans and humans will mess up. I think most of the people on the ground are doing the best they can with what they have and with the situation they‚Äôre in. \nThe other part, which I personally feel is a much larger issue, is the rampant disinformation and/or misunderstanding of how things operate and what is actually happening. We all, both left and right tend to hover in our own little ecosystems when it comes to news and commentary. We hear it, it makes sense to us at the time so we believe it to be true and are not open to other opinions, especially if it is counter to what the narrative is in your news ecosystem. We lose sight of the fact that each side is spinning a narrative in this tug of war for political power and the people are the rope. The point of my post was to shed light on a specific elected official who voted a way that I, and many others disagree with. And that‚Äôs okay, that‚Äôs the tough part about being an elected official. You‚Äôre never going to make everyone happy. But the fact that he didn‚Äôt give a reason for his vote is appalling. He sees people in his community suffering and he‚Äôs making zero effort to encourage the speaker to bring the house back to reconsider the bill and get people the help they desperately need. Instead he‚Äôs busy running for attorney general. \nListen, if he wants to throw some caveats into the bill to mitigate against misuse of funds or misappropriation of funds, that‚Äôs fine. Debate it and if the majority agrees then vote on it and let it pass. But he‚Äôs seemingly not even willing to do that which makes me think he really doesn‚Äôt care.'}, {'Comment Author': 'FLVMS', 'Comment Body': ""I'm absolutely certain about one location where a tik tok person claimed that fema denied them and closed the camp and treating it like martial law.\n\n\nNone of it happened.

Rest assured, there is a ‚Äúlist‚Äù somewhere right now that is basically an inventory of all the bodies that have been recovered. The problem is that it‚Äôs likely filled with mostly‚ÄúJohn or Jane Doe‚Äù. It‚Äôs not a matter of hiding them, those are dead bodies who very likely have friends or family that will be looking for them. No one is going to just accept that a loved one is missing and will never be found. I mean, it certainly happens, but it‚Äôs very rare. And I can tell you with all certainty, the government is NOT going to run the risk of dozens, if not hundreds of bodies not being accounted for. That would be so much worse for them, from a PR standpoint to have hundreds of families all over the media complaining that all these bodies are unaccounted for. They have to make every reasonable effort to identify these people and that takes time, especially if, as you said, don‚Äôt have identification on them. They typically don‚Äôt make the lists public unless they have names and have already notified the families. Eventually, if they have not been able to identify them, they will add to the list as John or Jane Doe. \nIn addition, if you think about this objectively. How will a high death count negatively affect a politician? No government action caused this hurricane. No government action caused the flooding. Aside from maybe inaction of climate change. That‚Äôs a different conversation for a different time. But during and immediately after the storm is where a majority of the deaths occurred. As far as people dying after the storm and flooding. I read somewhere that the damaged areas, counting all the states affected, is about a big as the entire state of Massachusetts. And it‚Äôs extremely difficult terrain even in the best of times. No reasonable person should have such an unrealistic expectation that any government can coordinate that large of a search and rescue in time to save every survivor of the initial storm. I‚Äôm sorry, I get that is a difficult thing to hear, but it‚Äôs reality. Some people have died because they were not rescued in time.

Suggest you just copy paste the article into the comments.\n\nedit:\n\nThanks @HuddieLedbedder for the working link. \n\nhttps://archive.ph/XXZ4c\n\nText for those on low bandwidth: \n\n> FEMA flood maps underestimated the risk in North Carolina, analysis s‚Ä¶\n> Kevin Crowe\n> 9‚Äì11 minutes\n> \n> The federal government‚Äôs flood maps, which are used nationwide to signal areas vulnerable to inundation, vastly underestimated the flood risk faced by properties in the parts of North Carolina devastated by Hurricane Helene, according to data analyzed by The Washington Post.\n> \n> The analysis of flood risk data from First Street, a climate modeling group, found that just 2 percent of properties in the mountainous counties of western North Carolina fall inside areas marked as having a special risk of flooding. That ‚ÄúSpecial Flood Hazard Area‚Äù designation, which compels homeowners to buy flood insurance if they want to get a federally-backed mortgage, indicates where the Federal Emergency Management Agency sees a risk of a 1-in-100-year flood. Scientists consider that zone, which amounts to a 1 percent chance of flooding in a given year, as facing significant danger.\n> \n> In those mountainous areas, according to a Post analysis of First Street‚Äôs data, the number of properties at risk could be seven times higher than what FEMA flood maps indicate.\n> \n> The discrepancy shows how the agency‚Äôs maps ‚Äî which rely only on floods observed in the past and don‚Äôt take into account flooding from heavy rain, small streams and tributaries, or climate change‚Äôs future impact ‚Äî can fall short when assessing current risks in a wetter, hotter world.\n> \n> Hurricane Helene devastated the Appalachians late last month, dropping huge amounts of rainfall on mountain towns many thought were safe from extreme weather. The torrential precipitation obliterated roads, cut off communication systems, and left homes far from coastal areas flooded and destroyed.\n> \n> In Buncombe County, where rising waters swamped areas like Asheville and Swannanoa, First Street‚Äôs maps show a much larger area of flood risk than the FEMA maps. About 2,100 properties out of about 125,000 in the county are in FEMA‚Äôs flood zone compared with 19,500 under First Street‚Äôs model, according to The Post‚Äôs analysis.\n> \n> FEMA 100-year flood plain\n> \n> First Street 100-year flood plain\n> \n> 1-in-100 annual\n> \n> chance of flooding\n> \n> 1-in-100 annual\n> \n> chance of flooding\n> \n> Sources: Flood hazard data from FEMA, First Street. Map data ¬© OpenStreetMap contributors, Overture Maps Foundation.\n> \n> Flood experts say the maps need to be urgently updated to inform homeowners and prospective residents of their actual risk.\n> \n> ‚ÄúWe are now in an environment of constantly escalating risk,‚Äù said Carolyn Kousky, a flood insurance expert and the associate vice president for economics and policy at the Environmental Defense Fund. ‚ÄúAnd the maps aren‚Äôt keeping up.‚Äù\n> \n> Follow Climate & environment\n> \n> Former FEMA leaders and current agency officials, however, counter that the maps are not intended to be a full accounting of flood risk. Unlike First Street, a research and consulting group that offers climate-based risk assessments to companies and governments, FEMA is charged with mapping and regulating flood zones for the public.\n> \n> First Street‚Äôs model ‚Äî which incorporates flooding from heavy rain as well as from small streams and tributaries ‚Äî finds roughly twice as many U.S. properties are at risk of a 1-in-100-year flood compared with those that fall inside a FEMA flood zone.\n> \n> Many residents who suffered heavy flooding damage from Helene, including in Buncombe and Henderson counties in North Carolina, did not have coverage under the National Flood Insurance Program for those damages, according to an earlier Post analysis of FEMA data. The agency had just 949 active policies in Buncombe County when the storm hit.\n> \n> Many areas of western North Carolina affected by flooding had FEMA flood maps that were 12 to 15 years old, according to Anna Weber, a senior policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council. The maps covering Asheville were last updated in 2010, according to FEMA data. The agency says it evaluates the maps every five years and does not update them if the data still meets the standards of the program.\n> \n> The amount of rainfall Helene brought to North Carolina was rarer than a 1-in-100-year event ‚Äî meaning its full devastation might not have been captured by either model. But experts say that the larger the flood zone, the more residents may have been insured against the catastrophic damage the storm caused.\n> \n> Blake Smith, whose home is in Bat Cave, N.C., in Henderson County, barely escaped with his life when a wall of water and mud came crashing down around him in his river cabin last month. The 51-year-old found his home demolished ‚Äî entire walls ripped out, struts teetering over the rushing river below. His truck was crushed.\n> \n> Smith had never heard of the National Flood Insurance Program. His cabin was 120 years old. ‚ÄúEverything is just gone,‚Äù he said.\n> \n> The Post could not immediately confirm whether Smith‚Äôs home, which is on the edge of the federally designated Special Flood Hazard Area, was entirely in the zone.\n> \n> Experts have long warned that FEMA‚Äôs flood maps may be lagging behind the current science of flood risk. They do not take into account flooding caused by heavy precipitation ‚Äî which is expected to grow more intense as the Earth warms ‚Äî and look only at past flooding conditions, rather than future climate risk.\n> \n> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like you‚Äôre driving down the highway but you‚Äôre only looking in the rearview mirror,‚Äù Weber said.\n> \n> FEMA 100-year flood plain\n> \n> First Street 100-year flood plain\n> \n> 1-in-100 annual\n> \n> chance of flooding\n> \n> 1-in-100 annual\n> \n> chance of flooding\n> \n> Sources: Flood hazard data from FEMA, First Street. Map data ¬© OpenStreetMap contributors, Overture Maps Foundation.\n> \n> In Rutherford County, home to Chimney Rock and Lake Lure, around 9 percent of properties have a high risk of flooding under First Street‚Äôs model compared with 1 percent that are in the federal flood zone.\n> \n> Former and current agency officials say that regulations dictate what the flood maps take into account and aren‚Äôt intended to encapsulate all flood risks across the nation.\n> \n> Luis Rodriguez, FEMA‚Äôs engineering and modeling division director, said on a call with reporters Friday that developing the maps is a ‚Äúcollaborative effort‚Äù that involves consultation with state and local officials.\n> \n> ‚ÄúIt takes a long time to go through the process that is required under the statute,‚Äù he added.\n> \n> Updating the maps isn‚Äôt easy. Local officials often resist changes that show their areas more at risk, because the designation comes with extra costs. Once an area is designated in the special flood zone, buildings have to follow more stringent federal guidelines ‚Äî for example, ground floors of homes have to be built over the estimated height of a 1-in-100-year flood. The home insurance required for a mortgage can also cost homeowners thousands of dollars per year.\n> \n> Individual residents can appeal decisions placing them in the flood zone if they present new scientific evidence that FEMA did not incorporate into its decision-making. The result can be a lengthy political battle.\n> \n> Roy Wright, who directed the National Flood Insurance Program from 2015 until 2018, said in a phone interview that designating special flood hazard zones can prove unpopular.\n> \n> ‚ÄúIf the area of concern shrinks, no one says ‚Äòthank you,‚Äô‚Äù Wright said. ‚ÄúIf the area grows, people send hate mail. That‚Äôs what happens.‚Äù\n> \n> Debris is seen in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in Swannanoa, N.C., on Oct. 1. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n> \n> After Superstorm Sandy, the agency proposed new maps for New York City that would have doubled the area under the flood zone. The city appealed, arguing the agency had overstated the height of future storm surges and floods. The resulting agreement saved New Yorkers tens of millions of dollars in insurance premiums, according to FEMA.\n> \n> Experts say that even if the maps were originally intended for a more narrow purpose, they have become the way that most Americans view their risk of flooding.\n> \n> ‚ÄúThey really became the nations de facto flood risk communication products,‚Äù Kousky said in an email. ‚ÄúResidents and communities really need information on how flood risk is changing in the coming years.‚Äù\n> \n> The agency and the country face difficult decisions. If the FEMA flood zone had covered more of the Appalachians during Hurricane Helene, more homeowners would have been protected by flood insurance, reducing their reliance on government aid and speeding their recovery.\n> \n> That requirement, however, could also prove unaffordable for some of the poorest households. And without a mandate, many Americans might still choose to opt out of flood insurance ‚Äî even if they know they are vulnerable.\n> \n> ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre usually choosing between a family vacation to Disney World and an insurance product,‚Äù Wright said. ‚ÄúAnd guess what wins?‚Äù\n> \n> Many experts say that the entire system needs an overhaul to account for a new reality. ‚ÄúThese strategies to protect us from flooding are based in the past,‚Äù Weber said. ‚ÄúAll these systems that we rely on in our everyday lives were created for a climate that no longer exists.‚Äù\n> \n> Brianna Sacks in Bat Cave, N.C., contributed to this report.'}, {'Comment Author': 'hesreallygood', 'Comment Body': 'I used to work in a building that was barely in the 100 year flood plain and reviewed the maps before a different hurricane dumped rain on us.

FEMA, and the vast majority of every local government entity in NC, only requires the 100 yr floodplain to be regulated. The 100 yr event means there is only a 1% chance that event will occur in any given year, meaning there is a 26% chance that event will occur over a 30 year mortgage. An event like Helene has like a 0.01% chance of happening in any given year (in each respective stream basin). It was a freak storm. If you regulate the floodplain for the  0.01% event then people in WNC would almost exclusively have to develop on ridges or steep slopes (which comes with its own dangers and complexities). There is no guarantee your house won‚Äôt flood if you are outside the 100 yr floodplain, it‚Äôs just that it will have to be a statistically unlikely event that finally reaches your property.\n\nAll that being said, I am all for FEMA taking a long hard look at recurrence intervals and adding factors of safety to account for what (to me) is the obvious increasing likelihood of these freak storms. But run that idea by real estate developers/agents and current landowners along the edge of existing regulated floodplains and let me know how much political push back you get.

Ok let‚Äôs ignore cost: same watershed scope it would take 10‚Äôs of years to do even the minimal amount of ground truthing and surveying.

"IRS announces tax relief for victims of Hurricane Helene in North Carolina; various deadlines postponed to May 1, 2025","From: [https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-announces-tax-relief-for-victims-of-hurricane-helene-in-north-carolina-various-deadlines-postponed-to-may-1-2025](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-announces-tax-relief-for-victims-of-hurricane-helene-in-north-carolina-various-deadlines-postponed-to-may-1-2025)

&#x200B;

WASHINGTON ‚Äî The Internal Revenue Service announced today tax relief for individuals and businesses in the entire state of North Carolina that were affected by Hurricane Helene that began on Sept. 25, 2024. These taxpayers now have until May 1, 2025, to file various federal individual and business tax returns and make tax payments.

Following the disaster declaration issued by the [Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)](https://www.fema.gov/), individuals and households that reside or have a business in the entire state qualify for tax relief.

Affected taxpayers with returns and payments with due dates postponed until Feb. 3, 2025, due to Tropical Storm Debby in North Carolina ([NC-2024-07](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-announces-tax-relief-for-victims-of-tropical-storm-debby-in-north-carolina-various-deadlines-postponed-to-feb-3-2025)) will also now have until May 1, 2025, to file and/or pay.

The declaration permits the IRS to postpone certain tax-filing and tax-payment deadlines for taxpayers who reside or have a business in the disaster area. For instance, certain deadlines falling on or after Sept. 25, 2024, and before May 1, 2025, are granted additional time to file through May 1, 2025. As a result, affected individuals and businesses will have until May 1, 2025, to file returns and pay any taxes that were originally due during this period.

The May 1, 2025, filing deadline applies to:

* Individuals who had a valid extension to file their 2023 return due to run out on Oct. 15, 2024. The IRS noted, however, that because tax payments related to these 2023 returns were due on April 15, 2024, those payments are not eligible for this relief.
* Calendar-year corporations whose 2023 extensions run out on Oct. 15, 2024.

The May 1, 2025, deadline also applies to any payment normally due during this period, including the quarterly estimated tax payments due on Jan. 15 and April 15, 2025. The May 1, 2025, deadline also applies to the quarterly payroll and excise tax returns normally due on Oct. 31, 2024, and Jan. 31, and April 30, 2025. In addition, penalties on payroll and excise tax deposits due on or after Sept. 25, 2024, and before Oct. 10, 2024, will be abated as long as the tax deposits are made by Oct. 10, 2024.

If an affected taxpayer receives a late filing or late payment penalty notice from the IRS that has an original filing, payment or deposit due date that falls within the postponement period, the taxpayer should call the telephone number on the notice to have the IRS abate the penalty.

The IRS automatically identifies taxpayers located in the covered disaster area and applies filing and payment relief. But affected taxpayers who reside or have a business located outside the covered disaster area should call the IRS disaster hotline at 866-562-5227 to request this tax relief. Tax preparers located in the disaster area with clients located outside the disaster area can choose to use the [Bulk requests from practitioners for disaster relief](https://www.irs.gov/tax-professionals/bulk-requests-from-practitioners-for-disaster-relief) option, described on IRS.gov.

## Covered disaster area

The localities listed above constitutes a covered disaster area for purposes of Treas. Reg. ¬ß301.7508A-1(d)(2) and are entitled to the relief detailed below.

## Affected taxpayers

Taxpayers considered to be affected taxpayers eligible for the postponement of time to file returns, pay taxes and perform other time-sensitive acts are those taxpayers listed in Treas. Reg. ¬ß 301.7508A-1(d)(1), and include individuals who live, and businesses (including tax-exempt organizations) whose principal place of business is located, in the covered disaster area. Taxpayers not in the covered disaster area, but whose records necessary to meet a deadline listed in Treas. Reg. ¬ß 301.7508A-1(c) are in the covered disaster area, are also entitled to relief. In addition, all relief workers affiliated with a recognized government or philanthropic organization assisting in the relief activities in the covered disaster area and any individual visiting the covered disaster area who was killed or injured as a result of the disaster are entitled to relief.

Under section 7508A, the IRS gives affected taxpayers until May 1, 2025, to file most tax returns (including individual, corporate, and estate and trust income tax returns; partnership returns, S corporation returns, and trust returns; estate, gift, and generation-skipping transfer tax returns; annual information returns of tax-exempt organizations; and employment and certain excise tax returns), that have either an original or extended due date occurring on or after Sept. 26, 2024, and before May 1, 2025, are granted additional time to file through May 1, 2025.

Affected taxpayers that have an estimated income tax payment originally due on or after Sept. 26, 2024, are postponed through May 1, 2025, will not be subject to penalties for failure to pay estimated tax installments as long as such payments are paid on or before May 1, 2025.

The IRS also gives affected taxpayers until May 1, 2025, to perform other time-sensitive actions described in Treas. Reg. ¬ß 301.7508A-1(c)(1) and Rev. Proc. 2018-58, 2018-50 IRB 990 (Dec. 10, 2018), that are due to be performed on or after Sept. 26, 2024, and before May 1, 2025, are granted additional time to file through May 1, 2025.

This relief also includes the filing of Form 5500 series returns that were required to be filed on or after Sept. 26, 2024, and before May 1, 2025, are postponed through May 1, 2025, in the manner described in section 8 of Rev. Proc. 2018-58. The relief described in section 17 of Rev. Proc. 2018-58, pertaining to like-kind exchanges of property, also applies to certain taxpayers who are not otherwise affected taxpayers and may include acts required to be performed before or after the period above.

Unless an act is specifically listed in Rev. Proc. 2018-58, the postponement of time to file and pay does not apply to information returns in the W-2, 1094, 1095, 1097, 1098 or 1099 series; to Forms 1042-S, 3921, 3922 or 8027; or to employment and excise tax deposits. However, penalties on deposits due on or after Sept. 26, 2024, and before May 1, 2025, will be abated as long as the tax deposits were made by May 1, 2025.

## Casualty losses

Affected taxpayers in a federally declared disaster area have the option of claiming disaster-related casualty losses on their federal income tax return for either the year in which the event occurred, or the prior year. In this instance, the 2024 return normally filed next year), or the return for the prior year (the 2023 return filed this year). Taxpayers have extra time ‚Äì up to six months after the due date of the taxpayer‚Äôs federal income tax return for the disaster year (without regard to any extension of time to file) ‚Äì to make the election. See [Publication 547](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-547) for details. Individuals may deduct personal property losses that are not covered by insurance or other reimbursements. For details, see [Form 4684, Casualties and Thefts **PDF**](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f4684.pdf) and its [instructions **PDF**](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i4684.pdf). Affected taxpayers claiming the disaster loss on their return should put FEMA disaster declaration number, FEMA-3617--EM on any return. See [Publication 547](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-547) for details.

## Other relief

The IRS will waive the usual fees and requests for copies of previously filed tax returns for affected taxpayers. Taxpayers should put the assigned FEMA declaration number **(3617-EM)**, in bold letters at the top of [Form 4506, Request for Copy of Tax Return **PDF**](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f4506.pdf), or [Form 4506-T, Request for Transcript of Tax Return **PDF**](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f4506t.pdf), as appropriate, and submit it to the IRS.

Qualified disaster relief payments are generally excluded from gross income. This means that affected taxpayers can exclude from their gross income amounts received from a government agency for reasonable and necessary personal, family, living or funeral expenses, as well as for the repair or rehabilitation of their home, or for the repair or replacement of its contents. See [Publication 525](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-525) for details.

Additional relief may be available to affected taxpayers who participate in a retirement plan or individual retirement arrangement (IRA). For example, a taxpayer may be eligible to take a special disaster distribution that would not be subject to the additional 10% early distribution tax and allows the taxpayer to spread the income over three years. Taxpayers may also be eligible to make a hardship withdrawal. Each plan or IRA has specific rules and guidance for their participants to follow.

The IRS may provide additional disaster relief in the future.

Affected taxpayers who are contacted by the IRS on a collection or examination matter should explain how the disaster impacts them so that the IRS can provide appropriate consideration to their case.

Like, \\~100 miles west or so. Lots of supplies were staged east - out toward Old Fort, etc. \n\nThen the storm changed in two ways:\n\n1. It went MUCH more east, basically right over Asheville. This meant that Swannanoa-and-east, which were previously pretty clear, were suddenly in the mix. The I-40 bridge between Black Mountain and Old Fort was washed away, which prevented many of those supplies and aid from coming in from that direction. \n2. In addition to #1, which meant \\*more\\* of the storm hitting \\*more\\* of the Asheville area, the storm basically stalled out once it got to Asheville - it didn't really manage to get over the mountains into Tennessee. So all that rain hit the mountains and flowed down - back into Asheville and the FBO, area lakes, etc. \n\nNeither of those things were foreseen until late Thursday night, at which point it was too late. \n\nCompounding that, the loss of cell phone service meant that it was really Saturday afternoon before anyone \\*IN\\* Asheville could tell anyone \\*OUTSIDE\\* of Asheville how bad it really was. And by then, most of the major roads in/out of Asheville were unpassable, so even once we COULD get the word out, there wasn't really any way to get aid IN. \n\n  \nThere's always things that could have been done differently, but I don't really think there's much that anyone \\*failed\\* to do in this scenario.

"Asheville Flooding and Helene MEGATHREAD. Daytime Saturday 9/28/2024. VERY LIMITED COMMUNICATION (CELL, INTERNET, RADIO)","HEY Y'ALL COMING HERE FROM GOOGLE--HERE IS A LINK TO THE ACTIVE, CURRENT MEGATHREAD:
https://www.reddit.com/r/asheville/comments/1fs63yr/asheville_megathread_post_helene/

**9/28 7:45 am: This is the new megathread. I'm gonna ask that we keep questions about neighborhood conditions here. If you have any resources, post them to the main page (r/Asheville) AND as a comment in this thread. I'll try to update this top level post with useful information.**

**9/28 9:15 pm: I'm headed to sleep. Will make a new megathread in the morning. Will wake up to feed the newborn a couple times and delete posts from the main page that belong in here. Still seems like communication is very difficult, so please be patient. It'll probably be a couple more days at least til cell service is back to something like normal. Other mod may still be around a bit. Finally, like last night, this thread is still like 90% questions that nobody know the answer to. Please check out the resources in this post before you ask a variant of the same question that's been asked 2000 times before. Most importantly, try to get some sleep.**

*Reposting resource links with new information on shelters and social media links for City of Asheville and the Fire Dept. Stay safe out there (or rather in here) everyone!*

But, if you don\'t need to do those things, it really helps to give  the first responders time. \n\nIf you\'re driving, the water needs to recede and then the responders need time to clear the roads for other responders. If you\'re able to give them a day or two, that will be extremely helpful in terms of not slowing down recovery. They need to clear trees. I\'m not familiar with how they will make the roads that have been washed away and destroyed passable, but that is not going to happen quickly. The roads will already be full of people who absolutely need to get in or people who don\'t know better. So, if you\'re able to stay off the roads for a bit, you\'re helping others. \n\nIf you are going to drive in, it helps to bring supplies from an area that has stores open. But, the best way to bring helpful supplies is to know what\'s needed because that will change very frequently during recovery. That requires being able to communicate with people in the disaster area. It sounds like they\'re still trying to get cell towers working. \n\nIf you\'re trying to fly into the airport, so far it sounds like it\'s closed. \n\nI\'m in shock seeing the devastation. I really hope everyone is safe and gets help soon.'}, {'Comment Author': 'goldbman', 'Comment Body': ""Thanks.

Urgent Help Needed: Providing Warm Clothes and Essentials to Families Affected by Hurricane Helene,"üö®Seeking assistanceüö®

As the temperatures drop, families in our community are still without basic necessities after Hurricane Helene, and the situation is becoming more urgent every day. I‚Äôve been working tirelessly to gather and deliver supplies like warm clothes, shoes, blankets, and toys for families, but there is still so much need. People are cold, and many are without power or a safe place to stay. I‚Äôm asking for your support to help me continue delivering supplies and providing relief to those who have lost everything.

My own family is also struggling to keep our power on and meet basic needs during this time, but I remain dedicated to helping our neighbors. If you‚Äôre able to donate, your contribution will go toward providing essential items to families in need and helping us stay afloat as we work together to rebuild. Every little bit helps, and I‚Äôm grateful for any support‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a donation or sharing this post. Thank you for standing with us.

I am also working with Mountain Projects. \n\nThere is a large amount of families who are in need, and not all of them can get the help they need from these organizations. Many need rides to get supplies, or to take showers. Many people don't have cars. I've also been working with multiple different churches to gather supplies for families, and I've been able to secure 10 Heaters,  36 sets of hats and gloves for adults and 12 sets for kids. I've spent countless hours Laundering clothes for families and sorting through donations, Laundering donations, and delivering all over western NC.\n\nI spent my morning delivering clean clothes to a family in Clyde (I dropped off a lot of supplies for them yesterday), then driving them to Asheville YMCA so they could shower. While they showered, I spoke to the YMCA about their needs and gave them information to offer families in need of things they did not have. Then I drove the family back home. Then I went to chat with Mountain Projects in Waynesville, and gathered more clothing for families and some toys. Then I went to Pleasant Balsam Baptist Church to sort through clothes to get the like new warm items, to take them home and launder them, bag them, and deliver them to families tomorrow. \n\nI have gotten many requests from families that have not been able to get help anywhere else. I'm here and willing to help. But I'm also transparent in noting that I need help too. My family of 4 is a single low-income family.  We have medicaid and SNAP benefits.

**UPDATES**

* **!!! BUNCOMBE COUNTY IS CURRENTLY UNDER A BOIL ADVISORY !!!**
* Listen to 99.9 Kiss Country in the radio, they're doing 24/7 updates.
* Parts of WNC are now getting cell signal thanks to service providers doing what is called Disaster Roaming. Go into your settings, cellular, and turn on data roaming.
* WCU students are safe. Campus has wifi, food, and the school is letting students use the campus phones to make phone calls to their family and loved ones.
* At this time it is unconfirmed and cannot be confirmed for a few more days but there is a possibility of another tropical storm coming our way. If so, it will not be nearly as bad as Helene.
* Apparently I-40W towards Waynesville is clear and from there the main highway from Sylva to Franklin is clear. Attempt this at your own risk.
* I-26E towards Charolette is apparently clear. Attempt this at your own risk.
* Sam's Club is giving out free water.
* There were people on Chunns Cove Rd past the Meadowview Apartments giving out free well water. Feel free to go by later to see if they're still out there to get some water, just bring your own container.
* There are reports of mutual aid organizers on the outside who are looking for info on gathering spots or small airfields to drop supplies.
* Black Mountain now has cell signal. Still no power or water.
* Swain County is still without cell signal.
* Candler area is still without cell signal.
* No internet, water, or power: Asheville‚Äôs water line is punctured, so there‚Äôs no running water, and it‚Äôs cash-only everywhere because of the power outage. Gas stations are completely out of gas, so it‚Äôs important to plan accordingly.
* Waynesville for gas & cash: Waynesville was running out of gas when we stopped by on Saturday afternoon, and it‚Äôs cash-only. However, they still have running water and electricity. I was able to get cash back at Walmart in Waynesville, which was super helpful since most ATMs are down.
* WiFi spot: The Best Buy in Waynesville has internet access, and we found WiFi by the library in Asheville. Make sure to download maps if you can find service or WiFi‚Äîit really helped us navigate out of there.
* Escape route: Despite warnings to stay put, we found it was a straight, easy drive to Atlanta. Once you‚Äôre about an hour and a half south, it‚Äôs like nothing ever happened. Power, water, internet, and gas are all available, and everything‚Äôs open. No flooding or debris along the route‚Äîit‚Äôs smooth sailing.
* Asheville Airport down, but Atlanta flights are fine: The Asheville airport is down, so we had to get our flights switched to Atlanta. Since Atlanta is fully functioning, we had no problem getting our flights rebooked, and we‚Äôre flying home today (Sunday the 29th) to Seattle without any issues.
* Important tips: Bring cash‚Äîmost places are cash-only, and ATMs are down. You can possibly get cash back at the Walmart in Waynesville. Download maps if possible for navigation, and make sure to detour through Waynesville if you need water, or cash.
* Sam's Club is no longer operational and is shutting down.
* Weaverville now has cell signal in some areas.
* ATMs are coming back online in downtown AVL, specifically around Patton and Haywood.
* Power is back on in the Jupiter area of Weaverville as well as cell signal.
* Mars Hill has power and cell signal.
* The Asheville Outlet Mall is setting up a food tent. I will be heading there shortly to offer assistance.
* I am heading up to the outlet mall now, I will update you all once I get there.

___

**From the press conference:**

* 20 trucks of water enroute

* 1 million MREs enroute

* Distribution sites to be announced once trucks arrive, not before. There is lots of transportation issues with roads, and at least 1 site in asheville that had supples was unavailable, which is causing challenges.

The power was beginning to fail again and his water flow was weakening as well.\n\nHe told me he\'d go back to the Starlink connection sometime today, so I\'ll see what I can find out from him and update this post.\n\nFresh update for those following this post, this is a direct text quote from my brother as of about mid-day Sunday: ""I know people as high as Rice Branch Road who have come down to help us on Spooks Branch.

you are allowed to be upset that asheville doesn't have potable water yet,"the work that the asheville water department has done to restore water after helene is heroic. the fact that recent major work on the north fork dam (the auxiliary spillway) stopped ""everything from black mountain to biltmore village"" from being literally destroyed is incredible. and the work they're doing now to get turbidity down and get us potable water as fast as possible seems to involve some actual cutting edge water science, it's remarkable

it is also true that at any point in the \~100 year history of asheville municipal water services, the city could have made a variety of different decisions about how to provide drinking water to the people of asheville, and some of them would have given us potable water back much faster after a major hurricane

two things can be true at the same time, and i'm seeing people repeatedly fight in the comments because they aren't taking the time to understand that both of these things are true right now. let's cheer on the water department's current work, while also allowing each other to dream about how we can avoid this outcome when the next helene comes",https://www.reddit.com/r/asheville/comments/1gd0j9c/you_are_allowed_to_be_upset_that_asheville_doesnt/,1729994127.0,stillgreenmoss,asheville,"[{'Comment Author': 'AutoModerator', 'Comment Body': 'Hey u/stillgreenmoss, it looks like you asking or commenting about the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.

If you wouldn‚Äôt mind re-linking to some of the information you have about high turbidity treatment in the state of North Carolina that would be appreciated by those of us who like clarity and factual comments.\n\nMaybe there are other factors to consider. Like do the filters in plants that treat high turbidity water cost more money to use day in and day out? Do they have to do it because their water has high turbidity every day? If the filtration process is considerably more expensive, does it make sense for a place like Asheville, North Carolina to install it and raise everyone‚Äôs water bill and the maintenance costs for an event that may happen once every hundred years or so? I was born and raised here and I can tell you that while I am not tax adverse there are a lot of people who are.

The City of Asheville is absolutely reaping what they have sewn by not working on infrastructure that people count on when there weren‚Äôt problems like hurricanes, floods or debilitating cold.  They should have put a plan in place that would have gradually replaced and upgraded the water system when it wasn‚Äôt an emergency.\n\nInstead they sat on their ass and now they are going to be forced to upgrade the system because large chunks of it are outright destroyed or just plain missing.

If you are running a generator, be sure to stop it for an hour each day and check the oil level. Add oil if needed to maintain the proper level. If you do not do this, the generator will eventually fail. This includes the large whole home generators that run on natural gas and portable generators that run on gasoline.\n2. Do not run a generator indoors or near doors or windows that will allow the exhaust to enter. If you were to do this, you risk carbon monoxide poisoning.\n3. Do not cook on a propane stove/grill indoors. Again, if you do this, you risk carbon monoxide poisoning.\n4. Do not cook on a charcoal grill indoors. Again, if you do this, you risk carbon monoxide poisoning.\n5. If you must sanitize your water, you can do so by boiling it vigorously for one minute.\n6. If your power comes back on, but you do not have water in your water heater, turn your water heater off at the breaker. It will burn it up if you do not.\n7.

Damage to Black Mountain and towns in Western NC has been catastrophic. Since Friday, September 27, the town government, police, and fire departments have been working around the clock to reach town residents and provide critical support. Due to the rapidly changing situation, daily updates will be provided through press releases and community meetings. Community meetings will be held daily at 3:00pm at Town Square Park.  \n  \nTown water and sewer systems are still down. Restoration of running water is still unknown. The Town of Black Mountain Public Works Department is working today to access the water treatment plant to perform a damage assessment. Water restoration within the Town of Black Mountain will be dependent on the North Fork water line, which received significant damage.  \n  \nLate yesterday evening, power was restored to portions of downtown Black Mountain. The majority of Black Mountain, Montreat and Ridgecrest remain without power. Power restoration will occur as lines are cleared. With the restoration of power to the downtown area, several local gas stations have been able to reopen today. Shipments of fuel into the area are limited and inconsistent. We encourage you to conserve fuel as much as possible.  \n  \nThe Black Mountain Fire Department has checked the majority of houses in Black Mountain, Montreat and Ridgecrest for stranded residents. Operations are now shifting to return to damaged residences to mitigate fire risks, as power begins to be restored.  \nThis afternoon, east and westbound lanes of Interstate 40 opened between Ridgecrest and Old Fort. I-26 East remains open to South Carolina. The Black Mountain Police Department will have officers at exits off I-40 limiting access to residents and support services (including donations). Limiting access will ensure public safety for citizens due to the extensive hazards associated with storm damage.  \n  \nSupplies of food and drinking water are available daily for distribution from 9:00 am-7:00pm at Ingles in Black Mountain, 550 NC-9. Food and water are continuously coming into our community, and each day we continue to receive more supplies. Hot meals will be served starting at lunchtime today and will be available for residents for lunch and dinner at the food and water distribution site. There are many community organizations also distributing hot meals including area churches, restaurants and non-profit organizations.  \n  \nPublic restrooms (port-a-johns) are available at the Visitor Center/Chamber of Commerce parking lot at 201 East State Street.  \nWe encourage you to utilize NC 211 who can provide assistance to those who may be looking for someone.

This from the NC Dept of Insurance:\n\nhttps://www.ncdoi.gov/\n\nFEMA has declared Individual Assistance (IA) for Hurricane Helene. What does this mean for you? It means that you can apply for disaster assistance from FEMA to help offset your disaster-related expenses.\xa0\xa0You can apply online at https://www.disasterassistance.gov/ or by telephone at (800) 621-3362. Otherwise, you can download the FEMA weather app from Google PlayStore or the Apple Store and you can apply for assistance on the app and upload receipts. Whichever method you choose, the form has a few questions that are tricky. To avoid delay, please follow the following tips:\n\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0One of the questions that FEMA will ask when you register is ‚ÄúDo You Have Emergency Needs‚Äù? This means during your evacuation or since staying at home during the disaster, do you need help with Gas, Medication, Food (meals, water, had no power and everything spoils), Shelter (you are staying with friends, family or in a hotel); Clothing; or Durable Medical Equipment (oxygen, walkers, cane, glasses, all major equipment, etc). If this is true, say ‚ÄúYES‚Äù to this question. That will result in your receiving Displacement / Critical Needs Assistance, which is $750.\n\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0When asked if your home is/was accessible, answer ‚ÄúNO‚Äù if there was debris, tree branches, continued flooding, loss of power, damage or destruction that prevented you from staying there after Helene. This question is asking whether you can stay at your home or apartment and will trigger the ability for you to receive assistance to pay for hotels or provide funding to use while you stay with family or friends.\n\n3.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0When asked if utilities are out, say ‚ÄúYES‚Äù even if your utilities were out for a few days. This triggers assistance $ to stay somewhere other than your home or to buy fuel to power a generator.\n\n4.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0When asked ‚ÄúAre you willing to relocate‚Äù say ‚ÄúYES‚Äù if you cannot live in your home due to damage, loss of power, etc. This question means you are willing to stay in a hotel or apartment temporarily, and triggers that funding for you. It is not asking if you are willing to move away from your home permanently.\n5.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0If you bought or buy a generator, FEMA will reimburse you up to $629, but you must submit the receipt. If you bought a chainsaw, FEMA will reimburse you up to $219. Again, you need to provide the receipt. Save your receipts.'}, {'Comment Author': 'Unusual_Willow7109', 'Comment Body': 'Asheville Tool Library & WNC Repair Cafe will be offering chainsaw repair & sharpening, generator repairs, small electric work - limited to tools/machines needed to help with survival and rebuilding   \nWednesday 10/2 - 12pm   \n1022 Haywood Road - Parking lot behind firestorm books'}, {'Comment Author': 'fedforever123', 'Comment Body': 'Wondering about responsibility of tenants to keep paying rent/follow through on lease agreement if conditions are unlivable.

Here the Very Unoffical Rules, an amateur PSA from a local. \n\nThe **Very Unoffical** Rules for those who dare enter the Major Disaster Region devestated by Hurricane Helene (All of Western North Carolina. And parts of Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, and Virginia)\n\nRule 1 : **Self Sufficency** - If you must enter this Disaster Zone, then bring your own personal SURVIVAL SUPPLIES: Water (10+ gallons), Food, government ID, a good Map, more Gasoline than you think you need, and a Poop Plan (baggies and/or a bucket and toilet paper) and only dispose of waste in a sanitary waste system. And medicine and whatever else you need. You must be absolutely self-sufficent and prepared. PLEASE try not to buy these things within ~25 miles of the disaster region; buy as far away as possible to conserve our limited supplies for locals in need.\n\nRule 2 : **Risk Awareness & Aversion** - While there are now some ""safe routes"", be aware that you may be forced off the ""safe route"" unexpectedly (flat tire, construction detour, etc).  This Disaster Region has a higher risk of death, if you travel into here, be aware. Flood damage is often unseeable.  Damage roads can collapse unexpectedly and deadly.  Be risk averse.  Drive slower than the speed limit. Downed wires are dangerous. If you get hurt and need 911, (if 911 even works!) you risk indirectly harming or killing a Helene victim who needed that first responder you took.\n\nRule 3 : **Community Service** - If you enter this Disaster Zone, you should have an sense of community service duty.  If you are not intending, or willing, to be in the service of saving lives, please avoid all of Western North Carolina and go around.\n\nThank you for reading.

* Apparently I-40W towards Waynesville is clear and from there the main highway from Sylva to Franklin is clear. Attempt this at your own risk.
* I-26E towards Charlotte is clear

**From the press conference:**

* 20 trucks of water enroute
* 1 million MREs enroute
* Distribution sites to be announced once trucks arrive, not before. There is lots of transportation issues with roads, and at least 1 site in asheville that had supples was unavailable, which is causing challenges.

The best way to do it is in PLAIN TEXT.\n\nThe worst way to send info - sending links to websites. Many phones can receive messages right now but struggle to load websites.\n\nThe second worst way - sending images of text (screenshots). Pictures take up way more bandwidth than plain text and can fail to load and clog up the available bandwidth.\n\n**THE BEST WAY** - send plain text only via SMS. SMS works differently that MMS (picture messaging) and uses data channels that are normally unused on the cellular network and will be MUCH more reliable. SMS may work even if data/internet is not working on phones.\n\nThis also means, try to avoid using apps like Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, etc if you can use SMS instead to directly message people. Those apps require a data connection (aka internet) to work, which may fail compared to SMS text messaging. \n\nI'm posting this because I'm seeing people suggesting sending screenshots of text, instead of sending links to pages. Sending screenshots of text is only slightly better than sending links to webpages. It's technically true that a picture may load better than an entire webpage (depends on the webpage - In fact some webpages are pretty lean and a high-res screenshot can be *worse*), but SMS messages with no images is far and away the most reliable way to directly communicate and uses a tiny fraction of bandwidth on the network vs the other methods. And many phones may have access to ONLY basic cell service and NO data at all, in which case NEITHER images nor internet links will work. Use SMS if you can.\n\nSource: I work for a mobile phone carrier and have for over 20 years.\n\nIn this thread alone people are posting many screenshots of web pages.

We are more than willing but have been hesitant mostly due to insistence on avoiding traveling to the area. Our communication with local groups has been sporadic for obvious reasons and so we are looking for some guidance here. From what I have gathered travel into the Asheville area would be possible using I-26 from the South. If we were to setup a temporary clinic is there an ideal location central to where people and their pets would be able to access us and receive services if needed? Any other advice before heading that way?\n\nNormally, our primary focus is wellness but we are prepared to treat some urgent medical conditions as well as minor urgent surgical procedures (such as wound repairs, etc). Our services are always free. We would be self sufficient with our own mobile accomodations, food, water, toilet, etc and as much gas as we can carry to keep our generator running as needed. If needed we would return home to resupply.\n\nWestern NC is near and dear to our hearts. We have worked with many groups in the region in the past offering free vet services to those in need and only want to help without being a hindrance. Our deepest sympathies go out to all those affected.\n\nNote: I will update this post with our contact information once we have a solid plan so that anyone in need of veterinary care can be in touch.'}, {'Comment Author': 'elxdandy', 'Comment Body': ""Can anyone working at mission give me information what the situation there is like?

Good article on the water restoration efforts as of the update yesterday. We just got another update from the city emailed to us. Here it is: \n\nMaterials, equipment & personnel are on the ground at all three water treatment plants. At North Fork, contractors are focusing on rebuilding the 36-inch bypass line that Helene destroyed. That line serves 80 percent of Asheville water customers, most of whom are north of the Blue Ridge Parkway.\nComplications from debris clogging what remains of the bypass line and then rainfall in the watershed after Helene arose on Friday and Saturday. While progress slowed, work continued. On Sunday morning, contractors were able to install new sections of the bypass line.\n\n\nThose complications are an illustration of the impossibility of providing an accurate timeline for service restoration. Full system operations are still potentially weeks away\n\n\nDamage assessments continue at William DeBruhl treatment plant in Bee Tree, after NCDOT crews cleared the road.\n\n\nMills River plant, which serves South Asheville, is operating at near-maximum output. Customers who have maintained water service are likely to remain in service.. Customers whose service was disrupted should begin to regain it.\n\n\nIt is important to note that a boil water advisory remains in effect for customers whose water service is returning. If you plan to use water for drinking, cooking, or any other form of ingestion (including brushing teeth), please boil it vigorously for a minimum of one minute beforehand. Water straight out of the tap is safe for bathing and washing dishes.\n\n\nAs service returns, pressure may fluctuate and/or air may be present in water lines. This could cause initial flow out of the tap to be sporadic.\n\n\nAdditionally, customers with water in South Asheville should employ conservation measures that will allow us to expand the service area as much as possible. Conserving water does not mean you should use no water ‚Äî normal use like flushing toilets and short showers should not cause the system to lose pressure. Large volume activities like filling bathtubs, long showers, watering landscaping, filling swimming pools, and washing vehicles will drastically increase the likelihood of service disruption.\n\n\nWater Resources thanks our customers for their patience while we continue to make progress on rebuilding our catastrophically damaged water system.'}]"

"WaPo: FEMA maps missed parts of North Carolina devastated by Hurricane Helene, Post analysis shows","The federal government‚Äôs flood maps, which are used nationwide to signal areas vulnerable to inundation, vastly underestimated the flood risk faced by properties in the parts of North Carolina devastated by Hurricane Helene, according to data analyzed by The Washington Post.The analysis of flood risk data from First Street, a climate modeling group, found that just 2 percent of properties in the mountainous counties of western North Carolina fall inside areas marked as having a special risk of flooding. That ‚ÄúSpecial Flood Hazard Area‚Äù designation, which compels homeowners to buy flood insurance if they want to get a federally-backed mortgage, indicates where the Federal Emergency Management Agency sees a risk of a 1-in-100-year flood. Scientists consider that zone, which amounts to a 1 percent chance of flooding in a given year, as facing significant danger.In those mountainous areas, according to a Post analysis of First Street‚Äôs data, the number of properties at risk could be seven times higher than what FEMA flood maps indicate.The discrepancy shows how the agency‚Äôs maps ‚Äî which rely only on floods observed in the past and don‚Äôt take into account flooding from heavy rain, small streams and tributaries, or climate change‚Äôs future impact ‚Äî can fall short when assessing current risks in a wetter, hotter world.Hurricane Helene devastated the Appalachians late last month, dropping huge amounts of rainfall on mountain towns many thought were safe from extreme weather. The torrential precipitation obliterated roads, cut off communication systems, and left homes far from coastal areas flooded and destroyed.In Buncombe County, where rising waters swamped areas like Asheville and Swannanoa, First Street‚Äôs maps show a much larger area of flood risk than the FEMA maps. About 2,100 properties out of about 125,000 in the county are in FEMA‚Äôs flood zone compared with 19,500 under First Street‚Äôs model, according to The Post‚Äôs analysis.Flood experts say the maps need to be urgently updated to inform homeowners and prospective residents of their actual risk.‚ÄúWe are now in an environment of constantly escalating risk,‚Äù said Carolyn Kousky, a flood insurance expert and the associate vice president for economics and policy at the Environmental Defense Fund. ‚ÄúAnd the maps aren‚Äôt keeping up.‚ÄùFormer FEMA leaders and current agency officials, however, counter that the maps are not intended to be a full accounting of flood risk. Unlike First Street, a research and consulting group that offers climate-based risk assessments to companies and governments, FEMA is charged with mapping and regulating flood zones for the public.First Street‚Äôs model ‚Äî which incorporates flooding from heavy rain as well as from small streams and tributaries ‚Äî finds roughly twice as many U.S. properties are at risk of a 1-in-100-year flood compared with those that fall inside a FEMA flood zone.Many residents who suffered heavy flooding damage from Helene, including in Buncombe and Henderson counties in North Carolina, did not have coverage under the National Flood Insurance Program for those damages, according to an earlier Post analysis of FEMA data. The agency had just 949 active policies in Buncombe County when the storm hit.Many areas of western North Carolina affected by flooding had FEMA flood maps that were 12 to 15 years old, according to Anna Weber, a senior policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council. The maps covering Asheville were last updated in 2010, according to FEMA data. The agency says it evaluates the maps every five years and does not update them if the data still meets the standards of the program.The amount of rainfall Helene brought to North Carolina was rarer than a 1-in-100-year event ‚Äî meaning its full devastation might not have been captured by either model. But experts say that the larger the flood zone, the more residents may have been insured against the catastrophic damage the storm caused.Blake Smith, whose home is in Bat Cave, N.C., in Henderson County, barely escaped with his life when a wall of water and mud came crashing down around him in his river cabin last month. The 51-year-old found his home demolished ‚Äî entire walls ripped out, struts teetering over the rushing river below. His truck was crushed.Smith had never heard of the National Flood Insurance Program. His cabin was 120 years old. ‚ÄúEverything is just gone,‚Äù he said.The Post could not immediately confirm whether Smith‚Äôs home, which is on the edge of the federally designated Special Flood Hazard Area, was entirely in the zone.Experts have long warned that FEMA‚Äôs flood maps may be lagging behind the current science of flood risk. They do not take into account flooding caused by heavy precipitation ‚Äî which is expected to grow more intense as the Earth warms ‚Äî and look only at past flooding conditions, rather than future climate risk.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like you‚Äôre driving down the highway but you‚Äôre only looking in the rearview mirror,‚Äù Weber said.In Rutherford County, home to Chimney Rock and Lake Lure, around 9 percent of properties have a high risk of flooding under First Street‚Äôs model compared with 1 percent that are in the federal flood zone.Former and current agency officials say that regulations dictate what the flood maps take into account and aren‚Äôt intended to encapsulate all flood risks across the nation.Luis Rodriguez, FEMA‚Äôs engineering and modeling division director, said on a call with reporters Friday that developing the maps is a ‚Äúcollaborative effort‚Äù that involves consultation with state and local officials.‚ÄúIt takes a long time to go through the process that is required under the statute,‚Äù he added.Updating the maps isn‚Äôt easy. Local officials often resist changes that show their areas more at risk, because the designation comes with extra costs. Once an area is designated in the special flood zone, buildings have to follow more stringent federal guidelines ‚Äî for example, ground floors of homes have to be built over the estimated height of a 1-in-100-year flood. The home insurance required for a mortgage can also cost homeowners thousands of dollars per year.Individual residents can appeal decisions placing them in the flood zone if they present new scientific evidence that FEMA did not incorporate into its decision-making. The result can be a lengthy political battle.Roy Wright, who directed the National Flood Insurance Program from 2015 until 2018, said in a phone interview that designating special flood hazard zones can prove unpopular.‚ÄúIf the area of concern shrinks, no one says ‚Äòthank you,‚Äô‚Äù Wright said. ‚ÄúIf the area grows, people send hate mail. That‚Äôs what happens.‚ÄùDebris is seen in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in Swannanoa, N.C., on Oct. 1. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)After Superstorm Sandy, the agency proposed new maps for New York City that would have doubled the area under the flood zone. The city appealed, arguing the agency had overstated the height of future storm surges and floods. The resulting agreement saved New Yorkers tens of millions of dollars in insurance premiums, according to FEMA.Experts say that even if the maps were originally intended for a more narrow purpose, they have become the way that most Americans view their risk of flooding.‚ÄúThey really became the nations de facto flood risk communication products,‚Äù Kousky said in an email. ‚ÄúResidents and communities really need information on how flood risk is changing in the coming years.‚ÄùThe agency and the country face difficult decisions. If the FEMA flood zone had covered more of the Appalachians during Hurricane Helene, more homeowners would have been protected by flood insurance, reducing their reliance on government aid and speeding their recovery.That requirement, however, could also prove unaffordable for some of the poorest households. And without a mandate, many Americans might still choose to opt out of flood insurance ‚Äî even if they know they are vulnerable.‚ÄúThey‚Äôre usually choosing between a family vacation to Disney World and an insurance product,‚Äù Wright said. ‚ÄúAnd guess what wins?‚ÄùMany experts say that the entire system needs an overhaul to account for a new reality. ‚ÄúThese strategies to protect us from flooding are based in the past,‚Äù Weber said. ‚ÄúAll these systems that we rely on in our everyday lives were created for a climate that no longer exists.‚ÄùBrianna Sacks in Bat Cave, N.C., contributed to this report. #helene #westernnc #femamaps #asheville #ashevillenc ",https://www.reddit.com/r/asheville/comments/1g2zlsv/wapo_fema_maps_missed_parts_of_north_carolina/,1728852911.0,Spoiledrottenbaby,asheville,"[{'Comment Author': 'AutoModerator', 'Comment Body': 'Hey u/Spoiledrottenbaby, it looks like you asking or commenting about the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.

Recent studies by researchers at WCU show that most of the damage occurred in areas designated as a flood zone in FEMA FIRMs (Flood Insurance Rate Maps).\n\nSecond: While the FIRMs may have missed some things - especially along the edges of waterways and up some small branches - most of what happened should have been expected in an event like this (although I‚Äôm not sure anyone expected quite so much rain).\n\nThird: FEMA FIRMs were never meant to be the only planning tool for understanding storm or flood exposure. Unfortunately, many communities use them this way. \n\nFourth: Communities, property owners, developers, realtors, and politicians regularly push back on common sense rules that impede, or are thought to impede, economic development, even if they will provide significant public benefits in terms of reduced damage and casualties. Some places even spend money paying consultants to challenge and redo the modelling. Why? Because economic development interests loathe anything they believe will either cost money to implement or reduce revenue and profit. \n\nFifth: While First Street has done a good job raising awareness of the risks of flooding on a national level, their modeling of floods in areas like the southern Appalachians has not been formally validated.\n\nConclusion: We (society) need to do a better job understanding vulnerability, communicating it locally, and emphasizing the threat to those who are living or own property in the flood plain. \n\nI think Helene is one of those rare events when no one, and everyone, is to blame.'}, {'Comment Author': 'Beavers_build5', 'Comment Body': 'Thank you for sharing!'}, {'Comment Author': 'tarbender2', 'Comment Body': 'We should change the talking point to 1 in 30,000 year flood which is what some are saying certain areas were.'}, {'Comment Author': 'Spoiledrottenbaby', 'Comment Body': 'Thank you!

Click on the thumbnail and ""View in Map Viewer"" to see what it looks like. Our flood is bigger. If your symbology is the same is mine, the 500-year should be red. I will update if and when I get something else out.\n\nYall, I am a geomorphologist, and i cannot stress how big this is. This is going to change the way the river works, for a while. the cutbanks are moving downstream, the watersheds are changing, and it is going to be worse than we predicted.\n\n500-year flood isnt something that happens because its been 500 years since something like this happened. A flood like this has a 0.2% chance of happening in a given year.\n\nAnd the floods after this will be worse. When landslides happen, it changes the ability of the area to absorb water. More landslides = less vegetation, and less ability of the soil to soak up water.\n\nThe Swannanoa is usually at 2ft this time of year. It is currently at 23ft, which is higher than NOAA‚Äôs estimation of 21ft around 4pm. \n\nIts much better to know the cfs of a river. That is how many cubic feet of water are moving though an imaginary line on the river at any given point. A basketball (or chicken) is about a cubic foot. The French Broad usually moves about 2,000-5,000 during this time of year.\n\nIt is currently moving 70,000 and rising. The water has nowhere to go, our soils are saturated, and even if they weren‚Äôt, it is raining too hard, too fast for them to soak up anything, even without the landslides.\n\nThe flood will not be over when the water goes away. This is going to change the landscape of our area on half-millennial scale. \n\nYou cant compare this to the flood of 1916, because our infrastructure is not that of 1916, for better and worse.\n\nGet ready to dig in these next months. Restoration will only come from community effort and we all need to pitch in. \n\nPrayers to everyone. If you need anything, please let me know. I know Buncombe dropped the ball here.\n\nIf you want, I can run some data on your area and might be able to tell you what the impact should be for you, something the city shouldve done already. Just hmu.\n\n\n\nFucking leave if you still can.\n\n(EDIT) There is some basic GIS data online, if you can still get online.

There were no thunderstorms directly over the airport, just heavy rain. So that brings us to the obvious limiting factor - wind.\n\nThe winds were out of 100 degrees (ESE) at 35 knots. Most transport category aircraft have two to three wind limitations - crosswind, tailwind, and sometimes a taxi limit. Tailwind limitations can be eliminated by flying into the wind (except at some mountain airports that don't allow that), so crosswind is usually the deciding factor. This limitation varies greatly by aircraft - anywhere from 15 knots all the way up to 45 knots. I've never flown the aircraft in question for this flight - a Boeing 717 - but I believe its crosswind limit is pretty high, almost 40 or so.  \n  \nSo with a windspeed of 100/35, and departing on runway 17, the crosswind would have been roughly 33 knots, within limitations for this Delta aicraft.\n\nThat doesn't mean every aircraft will be able to in those conditions - I've flown several aircraft that were less than 30, which I believe the CRJ-700's that AA operates into AVL would be.

North Carolina Department of Transportation staff are on the ground rebuilding the road to that plant. Once road repairs are done, people and equipment can be delivered to the site to begin repairs to the plant.\n\nMills River Treatment Plant is functioning and providing water to some residents. The plant is being repaired and crews are working to get the pant to full capacity as soon as possible.\n\nNorth Fork Water Treatment Plant is operational but not delivering water due to no water available for it to treat from the reservoir. Reservoir water has high turbidity levels and cannot be used. The plant is currently accessible, and people are working on adequate repairs.\n\n**Distribution Systems**:\n\nThe damage to water distribution systems is extensive, even if plants are operational, water can't be delivered to the community if distribution systems are not available. Crews are making repairs to inaccessible areas as soon as possible.\n\n**Law Enforcement Update:**\n\nThe Asheville Police Department (APD) is under full patrol staffing. Many officers are working overtime to ensure safety. APD is also getting support from other police departments outside of the city. A curfew remains in effect from 7:30 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. Tragically, 61 lives have been lost in Buncombe County due to the storm. A reminder that when intersection traffic lights are not working, it becomes a four-way stop.

This includes information about road closures, supply stations, medical help, and so on. In other words, very little information of this sort about the little towns that also got devastated by the storm is reaching the people trapped in those areas.

(WLOS) ‚Äî Several thousand feet of water lines leaving Asheville‚Äôs main water source need to be replaced before water is restored to a majority of Buncombe County.\n\nAt the North Fork Reservoir, nobody can access it because large sections of the road are washed out and Buncombe County‚Äôs main water transmission lines are exposed and missing. A sound missing from many homes could be heard outside of Buncombe County‚Äôs Government Center on Tuesday, Oct. 1 ‚Äì running water coming from large tanker trucks. That means relief for a parched community, struggling for resources.\nStaff)\n\n‚ÄúWe do need water for the dog and everybody in our neighborhood, so I thought I would practice my strength and carry some gallons back to my car,‚Äù said Laura Wise, who was filling a five-gallon container.\n\nFor Wise and many others in these lines, reality is setting in that sites like these could be the norm for the coming weeks.\nWe have experienced catastrophic damage to our production systems and to our distribution systems,‚Äù said Clay Chandler, the City of Asheville Water Resources Public Information Officer to News 13 via a Zoom interview on Tuesday, Oct. 1.\n\nTHE GOOD NEWS\n\n‚ÄúRepair work started Saturday morning, so we‚Äôre 72 hours into the fix,‚Äù said Chandler.\n\nTHE NOT SO GOOD NEWS\n\nImages past where News 13 could travel show why it will take so long to repair. Many of the 24-inch and 36-inch transmission lines have washed away.\nThat means getting new lines to replace.\n\nWhat has been found is heavily damaged, several thousand feet worth. The City of Asheville Water Resources after winter storm issues installed bypass lines as a backup but those lines also failed.\n\n‚ÄúThose fail-safe lines that were put in ‚Äì Why weren‚Äôt they better protected?‚Äù News 13 asked Water Resources.\nSo that‚Äôs probably going to be an issue for the after action for this when this is all over,‚Äù Chandler answered.\nThe second issue Helene stirred up was the entire North Fork Reservoir.\n\n‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt treat it because it‚Äôs too cloudy, it‚Äôs too murky, it has sort of a chocolate milk appearance,‚Äù said Chandler.\n\nIt will take time to settle.\n\nThe North Fork facility that provides 70% of Buncombe County‚Äôs water is functional.\n\n‚ÄúOnce we have a way to distribute the water, the plants will be able to function,‚Äù said Chandler.\n\nMILLS RIVER WATER TREATMENT PLANT\n\nFor now, repairs are expected at the Mills River Treatment Facility, as it is the one water facility functioning at reduced capacity.\n\n‚ÄúWe have equipment scheduled to arrive on site today, that will increase the capacity,‚Äù said Chandler.\n\nBEE TREE WATER TREATMENT PLANT\n\nWater crews made access to its third facility Bee Tree on the night of Monday, Oct. 1.\n\n‚ÄúWater personnel did not have access to Bee Tree until last night,‚Äù said Chandler.\n\nThat facility remains offline and is being assessed.\n‚ÄúOur best timeline best and most educated timeline now is going to be weeks,‚Äù said Chandler.\n\nThis means water distribution sites will soon be as familiar as a kitchen sink.'}, {'Comment Author': 'Silly-Amphibian-1978', 'Comment Body': 'Thank you so much for posting this.

Also operating are the Burnsville Police Department and the North Carolina State Highway Patrol. FEMA and the National Guard are on the ground and providing support to the ongoing recovery and relief efforts.\n\nThe Yancey County EMS Director had ordered an ambulance strike team and received 5 ALS units to bolster the current EMS system. A second order for an ambulance strike team was sent and another 5 ALS units arrived last night to augment the current staffing and response to increased calls for service as well as increased response and transport times.\n\nThe Blue Ridge Regional Hospital is still up and running, they are operating on generator but fully operational. A federal Disaster Medical Assistance Team (DMAT) has set up in the parking lot and has similar capabilities as the hospital to assist with care. Burnsville Health Center urgent care is opening today (10/02/2024) with hours from 09:00-12:00\n\nCell phone towers- Still a work in progress, some of the tower sites are still in working order but access to maintain them and get them back up and running is difficult due to post storm conditions. Crews are actively clearing and improving roadways to these sites to allow access for essential crews.\n\nPoints of Distribution Sites- POD sites are distributing water, MRE‚Äôs, and ice and currently operating out of the local fire stations with a plan to transition to two centralized locations. These new sites have already been identified and preparations are being made to get these sites up and running by Thursday.\n\nShelter sites- Blue Ridge Elementary School has reached capacity and we‚Äôve opened a second shelter location at Cane River Middle School. If needed, we can also open a third site as the need arises. These sites are being managed and staffed by the American Red Cross.\n\nElectric service- is beginning to come on in areas that are able to safely receive electricity.\n\nWater Treatment- The Burnsville Public Works is working diligently to get the water plant back up and running. Engineers, contractors, and crews are getting pumps in place to bring water back into the plant, once its determined the plant can sustain operations they will begin turning feeder lines on to distribute water. As feeders are turned back on crews will be able to determine if and where any leaks are to begin further repairs. Once reestablished the water must be boiled until the system can be flushed and sanitized. The water will be usable for showering and flushing toilets though.\n\nWaste water treatment- The plant is completely offline until major repairs can be completed. Engineers have been brought in the evaluate these issues and expedite repairs.\n\nVolunteer donations- All donations are being directed to Altec and will be distributed out from there.\n\nComfort stations- Mobile laundry facilities are available in the GO Grocery parking lot. Updates regarding the setup of shower and bathroom facilities will be provided as those details become available.'}, {'Comment Author': 'ExitAcceptable', 'Comment Body': 'Signal is super spotty for both Verizon and ATT.

If you are in S Asheville good chance you already have it or soon will.\n\n70% of Asheville gets its water from the North Fork Water Plant, which is completely cut off not only in terms of water line but also access. The road to NF is in horrific shape. Many places of actual roadbed have been completely washed away, so it\'s not just repairing the road, but rebuilding it from ground up (for folks that don\'t know, there\'s roughly 18"" of  prepared material between the earth and the road surface to support the weight of vehicles, especially leading to major infrastructure like a water plant.\n\nThe pipe ran alongside that road. Much of the length of that pipe was 36"" water main. Big stuff. Thousands of feet of that pipe are gone or broken. But to fix that, they need to fix the road first to get the pipe and repair equipment up first.\n\nThen once they manage to get all that mess reconnected to Asheville proper, they\'ll have all sorts of places where water lines were broken, leading to low pressure, which is a health hazard. They will need to get much of that repaired to maintain a high enough pressure in the lines to remove the health hazards.\n\nOn top of ALLLLLL that, the reservoir that feeds North Fork has had significant turbidity... basically the reservoir got VERY churned up and full of flood debris, so the water at the intake level is a mess. In order to start effectively and safely using that water, the reservoir needs to settle. That\'s going to take some time.\n\n**TLDR: IMHO, they are being very... VERY... optimistic in quoting a few weeks for repair. MAYBE some areas of Asheville get water in a few weeks, but it\'s going to be much of the remainder of 2024 before the majority of Asheville has running water without a boil order for consumption, brushing teeth, and bathing.**\n\n  \nEditing to add: if you were in a more remote area served by Bee or North Fork, I think you are properly fucked for QAAAUIIITEEEE some time before you get safe running water.'}, {'Comment Author': 'Mortonsbrand', 'Comment Body': 'Multiple weeks is their best guess.'}, {'Comment Author': 'jordantc', 'Comment Body': 'Extra care, extra patience.

__PLEASE NOTE (9/27/2024 @ 7:00 pm EDT): Wifi and cell service is very spotty at best in Asheville. I think most of the actual residents are not able to connect to reddit and answer questions. I hope and bet that your family is ok, but that they are not able to get online communicate via cell service__

**9/27 11:55 pm: Alright y'all. Ya mod is headed to sleep. I suggest you all do the same. We have a new mod helping out, but the other mods are all located in Asheville and have no internet access. As you can see this thread is 90% questions and 10% speculation. Hopefully communication with Asheville will be reestablished by tomorrow morning.**

**9/28 7:30 am: It looks like more locals are able to post updates based on some of the responses. Hopefully we will be able to reach our family and friends soon. Again there is currently very limited communication with Asheville and most people outside the area have no idea what is happening there. Please be patient**

Also serious injuries. All we have here now is Neighbor helping neighbor, trying to help aid and cope.  We are completely on our own right now. F&J Market, the laundromat, and everything on the river side of the road in that area is destroyed. It looks like bombs went off all over the community.  My neighbor saw a man floating down old 70 on top of his mobile home this morning, screaming for help. There was no way to help him.  The water was so fast. I'm sure there will be more casualties.

Power is also out pretty much all over the county so even if someone has service, their phone is likely dead/dying. It might be a while before you hear from your family. \n\nFor anyone in Asheville reading this, do NOT call 911 unless you have an actual emergency. They are only responding to life threatening emergencies so your back pain that‚Äôs been going on for months will not get an ambulance, your broken arm might have to wait for a couple hours, etc. Every ambulance in the county (about 15 minutes ago) responded to a mudslide in Garren Creek that killed quite a few people including a local fire chief. \n\nDo not think that because the rain has slowed/stopped that you are safe. There will be landslides, mudslides, structural collapses for the next few days so keep your head on a swivel and stay alert.'}, {'Comment Author': 'Square_Acadia_96', 'Comment Body': 'Just spoke to my mom in Black Mountain.

Duke keeps saying they\'ll let us know when they\'ll be give an estimate about power returning. We heard several loud bangs like more transformers blowing through the night, but I\'m not sure how that could be. I have to imagine these were trees falling.\n\n\nThe city has us on a boil water advisory, though we have to boil it on our camp stove, and it should be noted boiled water is a concern for pregnant people and children under 6 months.\n\n\nMost of the houses in the area I can walk or bike to are fine, unless a tree fell on them. There are many roads you can only get to on bikes. We have yet to see any official clean-up crews coming to start the efforts, probably because they can\'t get here yet.\n\n\nWe have a HAM radio operational here. Most folks don\'t have cell service, and they\'re trapped but they\'re okay. This is true across every county folks are able to call in from.

There‚Äôs not going to be power there for a few days. We made it out as 24 was starting to flood and got stranded between exits 44-51. All the land down to the right off the highway headed east bound were underwater but the higher ground was still ‚Äúdry‚Äù (but I think the water levels were still rising) and the downtown area near new Belgium seemed okay from the highway but I didn‚Äôt see it close up. Between exit 48-49 the highway was flooded, we made it through once when the water was just a few inches over the highway. We made it to Hendersonville around 11am and were effectively surrounded by water. We tried to turn back but the water level over the highway had risen to the point it was impassable. I saw people in service vans and dodge caravans flooding their engines and dying in the water. There were so many people stuck in that area with no power and potable water because the ground was contaminated and all the stores were dead so there was no supplies. The cell service there is non existent because there were so many people the towers that were up were just swamped. My group barely had Verizon service, t mobile was down. Those were the only two carriers we all had but there‚Äôs no shot the others were working by my estimation. The first responders radio relays were down so they were having to use cell phones to coordinate.  We were barely able to take some back roads around 3pm that hadn‚Äôt flooded once some trees were cut and cleared and passed the flooded part of the highway and were able to get out of there back to Charlotte. I didn‚Äôt regain cell phone service until like shelbyville. Honestly the only reason we had to push it was because we didn‚Äôt have enough potable water to last a day (fucking stupid I know) and the situation was looking to be extremely bad for a few days. I hope all your loved ones are doing okay, i imagine if they did evacuate they are stuck in Hendersonville, it‚Äôs where a lot of people seemed to have been stranded. We were pretty worried about how it would be after dark as people got more and more desperate just because there was absolutely no way to get any food or water supplies.  but hopefully other people were starting to maneuver their way out too (not that the route we went was advertised, the nc dot road update map was a god send)'}, {'Comment Author': 'Normal_poops', 'Comment Body': 'In Hendo, just west of downtown, near Hebron road/HVL country club area.

Hurricane Helene Disaster Assistance ,"I lived in Alleghany County, NC for five years. I no longer live there but seeing all the destruction is horrible. Maybe I have the wrong information, but please share the word. 



**1.) Finding Out If You Can Apply**

If you live in TN, VA, GA, SC, FL, or NC, you can apply for FEMA assistance if your county has been declared. Go to [FEMA Disaster Declarations](https://www.fema.gov/disaster/declarations) look for your state and the disaster (tropical storm/hurricane Helene) and make sure the number in parentheses started with DR. Click on your state, then click on where it says designated areas. You will see a map and a break down below. Look for individual assistance and see if your county is listed below. If so, you may apply for assistance, if not, you could still call and ask if you can apply. However, more than likely, if your county is not listed, you cannot. 

If you are US citizen of ANY age (you do not have to be 18 or older to apply) or have a child who is a US citizen with a valid social security number, you can apply for FEMA! 



**2.) Should I Apply?**

I recommend everyone in the affected areas apply. Once you miss the application deadline, you cannot go back to apply for assistance. Especially with this being a flood event, if you find out months later your home or property has mold or damages you did not see, if I am correct you can call back to your application and request additional assistance. 

It does not hurt you to apply. If you think you do not have bad damage, and you don‚Äôt want to take funds from other survivors, you are not! Please apply, you may have damage you don‚Äôt even know about yet. If you want to help people worse off, volunteer where you can, donate, share information, ask those in need, get active in your community.



**3.) Important Things to Remember Regarding Applying**

‚Ä¢Only one person per household/address can apply. So if you and your spouse or child apply separately, this may cause a delay, because it will look like fraud. Make sure to include whoever lives with you within your application.

‚Ä¢If you are a renter, please if you are calling the disaster assistance number or working with someone from FEMA registering you, please tell them you are a renter. I am unsure what kind of assistance you may receive, but at least try and clarify that. 

‚Ä¢If you are a renter with roommates, ask them whoever is assisting you whether your roommate should be added under your application or submit their own. I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm not sure how you should proceed. 



**4.) Trying to Prevent Fraud**

If you are being assisted in person, FEMA employees have badges. Ask to see their badge. NO, you cannot take pictures of it! Housing inspectors must also show their badges. 

If you receive a call about your application and they are asking for your social security number, do not share it! If you are calling for an application update, they will ask you to prove information based on the application to verify its you. But you should never be asked to share your whole SSN. When calling in you may be asked for your last four digits, but I can‚Äôt remember if they do that or not. 

Unfortunately during disasters, there is a lot of people willing to commit fraud and scam survivors. Please be vigilant. I would recommend for applying, you call the disaster assistance or go to a [FEMA Disaster Recovery Centers](https://egateway.fema.gov/ESF6/DRCLocator) However, as of right now, disaster recovery centers may not be open for some states just yet.



**5.) Engaging with FEMA**

I know people are frustrated and this is an extremely hard time. FEMA employees you meet work with a certain function and are limited sometimes in the tasks they can do at their level. 

If FEMA people approach your property, they may be trying to register you for assistance. If you do not want them there, please kindly ask them to leave or ask for the location of the nearest disaster recovery center or the number to call about your application. 

A large portion of FEMA employees are disaster survivors too. Whether it is someone who lives in the area, also affected, from another place currently affected, or affected from past disasters. They know the pain of losing their homes, having to rebuild, and watch their community struggle. You do not have to like them, but please kindly turn them away if you do not want help or to engage. Any anger you may have, especially if at FEMA directed at FEMA staff will not change issues. Voice your concerns and frustrations, but please remember they are people too. 



**6.) Complaints**

If you feel you have been discriminated against or you have concerns regarding your assistance, please go here: [FEMA Civil Rights](https://www.fema.gov/about/offices/civil-rights/external) Even if you do not feel like it applies to you, please look it over. They have flyers and brochures in multiple languages that explain your rights during a disaster. 



**7.) Cleaning Up/Debris Removal and Housing Inspections**

Take pictures!!! Please take pictures of any damages to your property and home before cleaning up. 

If your mattress is soaked and instead of being in the bedroom it‚Äôs in the living room, take a picture. Your car window is cracked? Picture. Throwing out food from your fridge? Take a picture. 

Document, document, document. Record anything damaged. During a housing inspection you want to show pictures to the inspector. Tell them what you loss, what is damaged, what you had to throw out, talk their ears off. 

If your housing inspector does not show you their badge, do not let them into your home! This could be fraud. If your housing inspector does not enter your home or stays for very little time, or you have any other issues or concerns regarding the inspection done at your home, call up and complain. Ask for another inspector or a reinspection, you may have to explain why you need one. 

**Update**: Inspectors may ask for proof of ID like a drivers license, but they are NOT suppose to take pictures of your ID! Please provide proof, but do not allow inspectors to take pictures of your license or property, and ask to see their badge. 



**8.) Supplies Purchased for Helene**

If you bought a generator, a chainsaw, or other items in preparation or after Helene hit, keep your receipts. 

I am not promising anything! But sometimes there is reimbursement for such items purchased for the storm. It varies based on disaster and state. 



**9.) Denial from FEMA for Assistance**

I hate this one the most. If you get a denial letter, please read it over. You may be denied because you have homeowners insurance, but what the letter may be asking is for proof of insurance. 

FEMA does not want to duplicate funds. As in, if your insurance company gives you $100 for missing shingles, and FEMA gives you $100 for the same missing shingles, you have a duplication of funds, and you may need to pay back FEMA. No, FEMA is not trying to ‚Äúgotcha!‚Äù anyone. They are simply trying to prevent a situation where that happens. 

This does not mean lying on your disaster assistance application! Doing that is FRAUD. Clearly communicate and keep FEMA in the loop regarding your insurance if you have any. If you can reach out to your insurance as soon as possible and see what you can get covered for regarding the storm. This does not mean delay applying for FEMA, again, you can apply and ask for updates to your application, especially as your insurance company begins to cover or deny your claims. 

If you got denied for other reasons, you can appeal! If you go to the Disaster Recovery Center, tell them you would like to appeal, and ask what steps you will need to take to do so.


**10.) Shelters**

Even if you do not need a shelter, please look at [Red Cross Services](https://www.redcross.org/get-help/disaster-relief-and-recovery-services/find-an-open-shelter.html) The Red Cross is providing supplies and resources. Please come take them! 

If you repeating ‚Äúbut I don‚Äôt want to take resources from others‚Äù do not worry about that. I‚Äôm serious. Take care of yourself, help neighbors, but these things are being given out for you and the community. Take it, please. Any meals they make that aren‚Äôt taken will go to waste, so please, again, take it. They also have counseling.



**11.) Counseling and Mental Health**

If you are suffering from mental health issues, or stressed about the events regarding the storm, please they have counselors. They want to help you, they are trained for it, and I‚Äôm sure many of them are survivors as well. Please reach out. This is not our average storm, where some trees came down, we broke out the chainsaw and cleared the road. This is a federally declared disaster, and people working in disaster relief know this is huge on a massive scale. If you feel overwhelmed, upset, irritable, sad, frustrated, anything, especially if it seems uncharacteristic for you or a loved one, please talk to a counselor. 

I have seen the aftermath to wildfires, floods, tornadoes, and I‚Äôm telling you, it breaks you, even people who would never identify as being sensitive. Reaching out doesn‚Äôt make you any less independent, resilient, strong, brave, etc. You cannot get past this without processing what has happened. Please, understand the warning signs of emotional distress, here‚Äôs a link to acute stress: [Acute Stress vs PTSD](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/acute-stress-disorder-vs-ptsd) 

As someone who comes from a military family, I promise you, PTSD is not just for soldiers. Disasters are traumatic events. You got to take care of yourself and look out for others. 

Please also look into this: [Reddit Post about Mental Health Resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/asheville/s/iUrFc8gI7u)



**12.) For Tarping Your Home**

Please go to the [Post About Roof Tarping Assistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Appalachia/s/ZMH6h7iX3f) if you need tarping for your roof.

**TDLR**: I have added resources about applying for assistance with FEMA and the Red Cross. If any information is wrong, I apologize in advance. 

Please take care of yourself. If you have needs such as a wellness check or help needing resources in North Carolina, please go to this post and comment under it: [NC Map of Help Needed](https://www.reddit.com/r/WNC/s/0UpVj1S3Aq) If there are other maps like this for other states, please post in the comments.

**Update**
I am not familiar with them, but here: [United Policyholders](https://uphelp.org/recovery/state-by-state-help/)

Met them in Maui, they also may be a resource to help navigate insurance.

the Trump Supported GFM for Hurricane Helene,"Does anyone have any info on how this GFM is being **disbursed**? Keyword is ""disbursed"" meaning paid out, not just allocated for.

So far all I can find is that they gave $25,000 to Mtn2Sea Ministries. Screenshot.

Fundraising question - making stickers and donations for Hurricane Helene efforts,"Hi all,

Tell me if this is completely off-base. I love making and designing stickers and want to be of assistance of the people affected by the hurricane (I'm from Arden). I would like to sell the stickers and mail them to folks with an additional amount added (stickers are around $2 each including printing and shipping- would love advice on how much more to add- maybe have people pick an amount?) that I would then donate to a local charity (probably the Asheville and Buncombe County United Way). I will donate 100% of the additional money. I would share with my networks online directly (not through a marketplace like Etsy to avoid having anyone profit from this) and have people Venmo me. First, is that okay tax-wise and second, does it even make sense to do something like this?

GoFundMe for Hurricane Helene reporting?,"Does anyone have any info on how this GFM is being **disbursed**? Keyword is ""disbursed"" meaning paid out, not just allocated for.  I can read what the GFM says where it says the four organizations *selected*, which again is not the same thing as *disbursed*. Has there been any reporting on it yet?

So far all I can find is that they gave $25,000 to Mtn2Sea Ministries. Screenshot.

The GFM is the ""Trump supported"" one.

HURRICANE HELENE : THE STORM IS OVER. NOW WE ARE WAITING FOR THE SUNSHINE. ALHAMDULILLAH üôè,"Today me and the kids decided we were going to take a ride and be led to where help was needed. 
In route, we stopped by his soccer field and it has been completely washed away ü•∫. 

Once we spent some time understanding what that means going forward we headed to our local Lowe's and hooked up with the FEMA team.

Survivor's guilt? Anyone else?,"As a survivor of Hurricane Helene. Finally getting cell service back I've seen the devistation out into Asheville and surrounding areas. I live in Maggie Valley. Communities wiped off the face of the earth. After we got power I had sat down to watch a movie and just relax after 5 days of no power or water. But I couldn't help think of the thousands still missing, people who have lost everything, and the ones who have lost their lives. And I can't help but feel guilty that I still have everything and can enjoy it. But it's unsettling and I haven't been able to fully relax. Is anyone else experiencing this?

It is very real, and normal in an event like you have been through. Survivor\'s Guilt is a form of PTSD, and recognizing that you are struggling with it is a crucial step in recovery. \n\nSharing my story because maybe it will help someone:\n\nMy story- I survived a direct hit from an EF3 tornado in 2018, and was a first responder to the event right after the tornado. After the first 4-5 days of chaos, assessing the damage, and figuring out where to start, the Survivor\'s Guilt set in. I remember that afternoon vividly; when I just sat down in my yard and cried and cried. I was suddenly overcome with emotions as it was the first time that I had allowed myself to think about what had actually happened to us, and how close I was to death.\n\nPart of my recovery was understanding and recognizing that our brains aren\'t trained in ""what to do when it happens to you."" For example, when we have drills or emergency plans, the event (tornado/hurricane/earthquake/flood/fire) never ACTUALLY happens.... Think about how many times you\'ve evacuated a building for a fire drill, compared to how many times the building has actually been on fire?? So our brains get conditioned to the ""emergency"" not being a real emergency... Naturally it takes lots of time and processing to come to terms with the fact the event actually happened, AND - we survived. \n\nFor my particular case of Survivor\'s Guilt, one of the things I struggled with was second guessing the decisions I made immediately before, during, and immediately after the tornado. \n\nI went to counseling after a few weeks of struggling, and professional counseling really did help me recover. \n\nOne key takeaway from my post tornado counseling applies to lots of areas of our lives: ""I made the best decisions I could, with the information that was available to me at the time."" Counseling also helped me understand that the guilt I was feeling was NORMAL, and healthy. And that it was normal to need some extra help given the scale of the emergency we had been through (which was tiny and isolated compared to the devastation I see in WNC).\n\nI encourage all of you guys to share your stories, and know that it is totally okay to be feeling like you are right now. It is NORMAL, and you will be able to get through this. Counseling really did help me, and I\'m sure others would benefit from it as well.\n\nIf it helps, remember this: You made the best decisions you could, with the information that was available to you at the time.\n\nTake care y\'all.

I know it\'s for the best - we only just got power back to our neighborhood, won\'t have water for weeks.\n\nBut still. Our apt and immediate neighborhood was (relatively) undamaged, albeit mere blocks uphill from the Biltmore Village/Swannanoa flood zone, and all we\'ve really lost is whatever was in the fridge and our chest freezer plus our travel expenses, plus my husband\'s income for the duration, which is going to be a serious financial hit for us, but is a mere inconvenience compared to what so many have lost. So now that we\'re safe and able to live a more or less ""normal"" life, the guilt is starting to weigh heavy, even though our having stayed to suffer there in solidarity wouldn\'t have benefited anyone or changed anything other than saving us the cost of tavel, and would have meant two more people competing for scarce water, food and gas with folks who didn\'t/don\'t have the option to leave.\n\nAdd to that, the Riverside Dr. area - the greenway and parks, Wedge, Marquee, the studios, etc - has been our mental health lifeline for the past few years, some place we could go and enjoy the art, maybe get a Chop Shop burger and ciders if we were feeling flush, go for a long walk along the river, etc. whenever things were piling up and we needed  mind/body ""R&R"" day.

So even the things we would normally do to cope with the stress we\'re going to be facing when we get back are no longer available to us for months if not longer, and some won\'t be ever again. And yet it feels so fucking selfish to even care about those things right now, even though I know intellectually that they\'re valid losses to grieve over.\n\nThis whole situation is just fuckery piled on fuckery piled on fuckery.

It\'s seemingly insensitive to counsel that you should avoid guilt and face that this was just pure tragedy that happened to others, at the expense of facing a much scarier existential reality amid all other current troubles, but blaming yourselves and festering guilt at this time will lead to significantly worse long-term outcomes for the area-wide PTS disorder.\n\nThe development of new substance addictions after this is going to be bad enough as it is, please y\'all don\'t curse yourselves further with self-blame. Just focus on supporting one another.\n\nEvery time you have an intrusive thought of what you might have done wrong or could have done better or even horrors of what could have gone worse, think about how lucky you are. I don\'t mean this in any ""religious"" way but what can you do best now, with this ""gift of survival""? What can you take as emotional and philosophical transformation in what does and doesn\'t matter in your life? What matters most, and what do you most want to do moving forward?\n\nI don\'t expect this block to magically make you feel better, but rather I think periodically considering these things could be distraction from negativity.\n\n-way too much counseling as a patient, not a provider \n\nRemember to moderate your despair with hope, temper your trauma with the swelling of community.'}, {'Comment Author': 'WildCompote5828', 'Comment Body': 'I got power back on tonight and was happy for about ten minutes, then started to cry because I feel so guilty.

Its not urgent but it does inspire hope, maybe life-saving hope, for those depressed, PTSD and suicidal folks.** \n\nHello Asheville, I started Survival Preparedness in these mountains a decade ago, as an Appalachian Trail Thru Hiker. I carried everything I needed to survive in a 30 pound backpack, hiking the highest ridges of our sacred Appalachian Mountians, eating ramen and canned meat, and sleeping on the cold ground. \n\nAfter that I became obsessed with Surviving and Thriving, not just for myself. For my home. I have been reseaching for years! how to help the Asheville Region survive this deadly climate change future.\nThis is my purpose in life. \nTo save lives here and now, by sharing my knowedge about Community Resilence and the Big 5 Survival Systems. \n\nBig 5 Survival Systems:\nTragically, all too obvious now, the Big 5 are\n\n1. Food\n\n2. Water\n\n3. Shelter\n\n4. Energy / Transportation (electricity/fuel)\n\n5. Communication/ Community Support\n\nHave yall heard of the term, Microgrid?\n\nMicrogrid is a radical and self-reliant Big 5 system, that can be fully independent of the regional grid, OR interconnected with other Grids and Microgrids, and can be switched on, *whenever* you need. \n\nFor example, Rainwater Catchment. Its very simple, and affordable.  Basically its a roof pr a tarp even, that directs rainwater, *free water from the heavens*, hallelujah, and then you have a water filter and then it goes into your water storage tank. A primitive household system can be like $100.  Or scale it up to a large communal system, that could support like 10 or 20 or more neighbors. \n\nAnd we can rebuild MULTIPLE overlapping Microgrids for redundancy. So you have not only one Rainwater cachment, maybe also build a groundwater well for you community. And *then* also, rebuild that municiple water connection.  Thats 3 Water Systems right there. That is resilience. and preparness for our uncertain future in the face of climate change and natural disasters.\n\nAnd we need the Big 5 Survival Systems (Food Water Shelter Energy and Communication) at every human level. \n\n**Theres 5 human levels**\n\nLevel 1 : regional\n\nLevel 2 : town, or city \n\nThen level 3, that CRUCIAL level most of us lacked before the hurrucame : neighborhood HUBS (That is 50-500 neighbors, give or take) Coming together Thats what I see y'all creating right now. \n\nLevel 4 is also sadly broken for many of us and really all over America. Level 4 is our Familiar Cluster (about 10-50 folks) our closest people. Those people who you wanted to call first, on Day 1 of this tragedy. Thats your Familiar Cluster. \n\nAnd lastly, level 5, the smallest but mighty, which is the household (typically 1-6 people). \n\nSo When the Level 1, the Region, collapses. Or level 2, the town collapses, We need our strong neighborhood hubs, our level 3. To step up. To suruvive together. And it see it here, I am so proud of y'all stepping to create all these new neighborhood hubs. \n\nBut we need to Rebuild Radical Resilence on ALL of the 5 levels.  \n\nHow?\nWell if you can, I know theres more urgent matters for many of us, but if you have time - \n\nDocument what structures and infrastructures fares better or worse than others and examine why and how?\n\nFrom there we can gain valuable knowledge. \n\nIf you have the internet and time, research these terms : Microgrids, Resilient Communities, Intentional Communites, Strong Towns, Off Grid Homesteading, Library Economies and Gifting Economy, 5 Minute Cities (it could also be a 5 Minite Holler) imagine how much better this situation wouls be, if everyone had access to a Local Neighborhood Hub or multiple Hubs nearby (which might include a starlink, a food and water bunker, and a little community building with a communial kitchen and free library for sharing tools and stuff) In the future, you could have access to ALL in a your HUB thats within a 5 minute walk, We could do this. \n\nAlso I want us to research Cyclical and Sustainable Systems, Freedom from Car Dependency. THATS the big one. To NOT be dependent on cars and trucks and fossil fuel and interstate roads for our survival.  \n\nI could list more amazing radical terms, another day. \n\nOne last thing. Its important. Rebuilding Radical Resilience isnt just about physical infrastructure. Social infrastructure is essential. Community gathering spaces. Community organizing frameworks. Consensus Democracy. How do neighbors resolve issue together with fairness and inclusivity?  What is your ideal community? \n\nEveryone deserves Food Water Energy Shelter Community Security Love.  \n\nLets Rebuild Radical Resilence.\n\nBecuase another hurricane will eventually come for us.\n\nMaybe not for 5 years or 50 years or 500 years... And when it comes, I want you and your community, to be ready, and have secure resilient Big 5 Survival Systems.  The dream is to survive climate change's disasters. And the bigger dream, what I feel when I look at the stars at night, I dream for us to *thrive*.""}, {'Comment Author': 'Downtown_West_5586', 'Comment Body': 'Has anyone tried to drive back into Asheville from 26 South?

After Tropical Storm Helene, it‚Äôs likely that huge numbers of tenants will experience difficulty paying their rent and fixing their homes.\n\nDavid Bartholomew, an attorney with Pisgah Legal Services, says special rules apply right after a storm like this, particularly as lack of electricity has interrupted residents‚Äô access to their bank accounts.\n\n‚ÄúTenants are going to have the option of canceling their lease if they need to, but they also have a right to stay there in the property and require the landlord to fix it,‚Äù Bartholomew said.\n\nIn North Carolina, evictions can only happen through the court system. And it your county court is closed, you can‚Äôt get evicted.\n\nUntil Oct. 14, Bartholomew said, ‚ÄúLegally, you can‚Äôt be kicked out. You can‚Äôt be locked out. And it landlords are trying to tell tenants that they have to leave, tenants should respond that they have to go through the court system.‚Äù The best thing to do is get requests for repairs in writing, whether via text, email or letter. From that point, it becomes the landlord‚Äôs responsibility to take care of the issue, even if current circumstances may make the process longer.\n\nFEMA also helps tenants, not just homeowners. Tenants can apply for individual assistance on disasterassistance.gov. Individual assistance doesn‚Äôt just cover housing repairs, but also gas, food, utility bills, hotel stays and other disaster-\nassociated costs.\n\nIf tenants are confused about their rights or suspect that a landlord may be taking illegal actions against them, Pisgah Legal Services can be contacted online at pisgahlegal.org or 828-253-0406.‚Äù'}, {'Comment Author': 'ACEaton1483', 'Comment Body': 'This was such a thorough, lovely, and insightful comment.

Based on the situation you describe, it sounds like you could qualify for the Displacement / Critical Needs Assistance, which is $750, along with hopefully the hotel funding. \n\nHere is some good information about FEMA relief aid. This from the NC Dept of Insurance:\n\n[https://www.ncdoi.gov/](https://www.ncdoi.gov/)\n\nFEMA has declared Individual Assistance (IA) for Hurricane Helene. What does this mean for you? It means that you can apply for disaster assistance from FEMA to help offset your disaster-related expenses.\xa0\xa0You can apply online at\xa0[https://www.disasterassistance.gov/](https://www.disasterassistance.gov/)\xa0or by telephone at (800) 621-3362. Otherwise, you can download the FEMA weather app from Google PlayStore or the Apple Store and you can apply for assistance on the app and upload receipts. Whichever method you choose, the form has a few questions that are tricky. To avoid delay, please follow the following tips:\n\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0One of the questions that FEMA will ask when you register is ‚ÄúDo You Have Emergency Needs‚Äù? This means during your evacuation or since staying at home during the disaster, do you need help with Gas, Medication, Food (meals, water, had no power and everything spoils), Shelter (you are staying with friends, family or in a hotel); Clothing; or Durable Medical Equipment (oxygen, walkers, cane, glasses, all major equipment, etc). If this is true, say ‚ÄúYES‚Äù to this question. That will result in your receiving Displacement / Critical Needs Assistance, which is $750.\n\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0When asked if your home is/was accessible, answer ‚ÄúNO‚Äù if there was debris, tree branches, continued flooding, loss of power, damage or destruction that prevented you from staying there after Helene. This question is asking whether you can stay at your home or apartment and will trigger the ability for you to receive assistance to pay for hotels or provide funding to use while you stay with family or friends.\n\n3.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0When asked if utilities are out, say ‚ÄúYES‚Äù even if your utilities were out for a few days. This triggers assistance $ to stay somewhere other than your home or to buy fuel to power a generator.\n\n4.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0When asked ‚ÄúAre you willing to relocate‚Äù say ‚ÄúYES‚Äù if you cannot live in your home due to damage, loss of power, etc. This question means you are willing to stay in a hotel or apartment temporarily, and triggers that funding for you. It is not asking if you are willing to move away from your home permanently. \n\n5.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0If you bought or buy a generator, FEMA will reimburse you up to $629, but you must submit the receipt. If you bought a chainsaw, FEMA will reimburse you up to $219. Again, you need to provide the receipt.

Is FEMA helping?\n\nA- Don't have census count from right before storm, as of this morning, there were a little more than 100 unhoused that are unaccounted for, do not have update since this morning.  As far as planning, working now on making sure resources are available, hoping to work on plans next week.  No assistance from FEMA at this time but not out of the question.\n\nQ- How many at Code Purple shelter?\n\nA- Transformation village - 80 women and children.  Not sure how many men are sheltered at county shelters.\n\nQ- Inaudible but related to unaccounted ppl\n\nA- S&R is currently ongoing.  Difficult to provide a finite number because it changes rapidly, Register of Deeds also has to provide updates, communication gap.  When S&R have wrapped up, then there will be a finite number.  Any number right now is subject to change.\n\nQ- What are parameters for S&R to wrap up?\n\nA- Still accessing areas due to landslides, bridges out, rerouted rivers.  Using drones, canines, once those crews have exhausted all resources.....""}, {'Comment Author': 'nate_the_grate', 'Comment Body': 'What a time to be alive üòÇ'}, {'Comment Author': 'Analysis-Eastern', 'Comment Body': 'The biggest of hugs and head kisses.

Asheville Flooding Megathread (Overnight): Post Updates Here!,"***Be on the lookout for a new thread with u/Hello_Hollow_Halo

I will be back on tonight to take back over for them. Be safe out there and until then please be sure to attempt to help others out in the comments!***

Hey everyone! I saw the OP was getting some rest. I work overnight so please feel free to send updates and I'll update this post as much as I possibly can (I'm aiming for every 30 minutes or so).

Previous Megathread (Daytime): https://www.reddit.com/r/asheville/s/doTkCZBvjt



9/26 00:00

Tunnel Rd is no longer flooded near the Shell Gas Station. It appears that the cause was Ross Creek getting blocked off just north of Kenilworth Knolls Rd, causing the creek to overflow onto Tunnel Rd. As the water level rose, the drain pipes eventually became unclogged, allowing the water from Tunnel Rd to drain. At this time it appears as if the creek is only halfway to truly overflowing its banks.

Parts of Blueridge Parkway are currently closed. I am unsure of which parts but I will update as soon as I find out.

Parkway Closure Locations:

Milepost 314 - 375.6 from north of Linville Falls to Ox Creek

Milepost 393 - 455 from the NC191/French Broad overlook to Soco Gap



9/26 00:40

Currently no updates.



9/26 01:00

Hurricane Helene has been bumped up to now a CAT 5 hurricane. I am unsure if this will affect our area but if you have any family down south please check on them!



9/26 01:30

Currently no updates. Starting at 02:00 I will be moving to updating hourly unless a major update comes in.



9/26 02:00

240W and 74 from Emma‚Äôs grove to Downtown were fine as of about 6:00am

Also update to the CAT 5 report: it is not currently a CAT 5 but some meteorologist stations are reporting predictions of it turning into a CAT 4 by landfall and some are predicting it will turn into a CAT 5 by landfall.



9/26 06:33

Dogwood road from Hookers Gap to Smoky Park Hwy is clear at this time. Smoky Park Hwy from Mountain Energy/Boones Corner to the interstate is clear at this time as well.



9/26 06:54

The French Broad River level is currently 6.5ft higher than normal.

Reports of a lot of standing water on Sweeten Creek. The user who notified me of this has a lifted tahoe and reported that it is not too dangerous at this time.



9/26 07:04

I am getting off of work and heading home. It's typically a 10 minute drive but we'll see how it goes. I will continue posting updates when I make it back home safely.



9/26 07:21

I made it home safely and will continue to post updates soon.

Sardis Rd and Sandhill Rd are safe, just please don't be an idiot and splash water all over oncoming traffic's windshield to where they can't see like this one person did to me.



9/26 07:35

Biltmore Lake area to New Leicester Hwy via Smokey Park/Patton roads are clear.

Candler to Sweeten Creek no major road hazards. Small limbs down, steady rain.

I-40 moving at 50/55 mph.

Rain gauge in Asheville is currently 7.5 inches in the past 24 hrs

Swannanoa river is over 10 ft now

Biltmore village was fine as of 7ish

I-26 is backed up due to an accident around french broad.



9/26 07:50

Bat cave road between cedar creek and old fort is okay. Reports of a foot of mud in some areas but enough trucks had already done it that it is apparently too bad. Dozens of driveways washed into the road so be careful with that added hazard

I-40 between old fort and black mtn totally fine at this time.



9/26 08:20

New Leicester to 240: some standing water but nothing deep enough to not drive through.

Swannanoa River is flowing down Swannanoa River Rd.

A group of able bodied young men there for a bachelor party are significantly more likely to be able to survive and find resources themselves than older/chronically ill/disabled folks.\n\nBefore submitting to this, consider if your loved one truly is in imminent danger or if you are just spiraling because you haven‚Äôt heard from them only one day after a once-in-a-lifetime natural disaster.'}, {'Comment Author': 'gravityyalwayyswins', 'Comment Body': ""Is the google sheet collecting contact info for the people submitting?

"And I can't fight this feelin anymoooore (yup, you know)","Hey, friends.

I'm tired today, and sick of feeling vulnerable, so I wasn't going to do this. But here we go.

The Katrina-Helene buddy system is up and running, and my experience has been nothing short of amazing. My match and I talked for over an hour the first night. Our personalities mesh so perfectly. Seriously, she fucking rules.

Then I finally got internet back that night and got stuck on YouTube watching all the videos others had taken of our devastation. I found it oddly satisfying to see the well-dressed, hopeful heroes come in to save the day! And by day four or five, they're... shredded. They've gotten it. Their entire demeanor has shifted.

I've also taken to going for shock value when far away friends want to talk, then shut down. I bombard them with pictures and truths. Why be gentle? It's oddly satisfying to feel them squirm. They're getting it.

Anyways. Since Katrina survivors* have been studying our news cycle, and offering their hearts, I wanted to understand them, too. (I was still in high school when their hurricane hit, and didn't remember much.) So, I watched the Spike Lee documentary ""When the Levees Broke."" Heads up, it is four hours long. It's tedious, and you want it to be over, but once it's done it doesn't seem long enough. 

It's very, very respectfully done. It's raw. It's real. I grabbed my teddy bear again. It's. Not a contest. But their situation was so FUCKED. Before, during, after. The injustices they suffered are infuriating. If you can stomach it, their story deserves to be remembered, too. MAJOR trigger warning, though. Please, please do not attempt if you aren't ready. You will see dead bodies. And some soulless live ones.

You will also see amazing feats of humanity, of hope. Splashes of color and life. Strength. So much strength.

But they were the fucking guinea pigs. If anything is going well here with the feds, it's because they learned. The hard way. Fucked up stuff.

I have a weird desire to know everything, to see everything, and that's just who I am. I want to understand. It feels important. It isn't for everyone. Proceed at your own comfort level.

I slept for about 12hrs after the documentary ended. Finally. Still had dreams about dirty water, disfigured bodies, cheese (always the cheese). But I slept. Finally.

And now I'm itchy (metaphorically, although I still have not showered). Hoping to use my new wave of anger for productive purposes. Starting tomorrow.

I'm just tired. The city is waking up, everyone wants to be fine. It isn't, though.

How's your head?

Most people who have interacted with them know better. They will arrive a week or more later than mutual aid. Red Cross will pick a location too far from people who need them the most. Don't get me started on the photos I've seen of the half empty boxes of food they hand out. FEMA will set up as if they've never done this before. People who need help will get different answers if they talk to different people. It will make no sense the way FEMA denies some people aid and not others. It will be chaos. FEMA has come back to demand funds back from people who received them a year or more later. Unfortunately, I really can't think of anything good to say.""}]"

So, 4 years later and we still need to bleach our dishwasher each week because it never dries out and mold builds up. We had a roach problem when we moved in from the previous tennets. When I moved in they were everywhere and the office staff said ""it\'s just a few bugs."" Coming from the north east I\'d never seen a roach so I didn\'t realize that\'s what they were.  Their pest people left our apartment a mess and didn\'t tell us what they used to get rid of a mouse we had(that came through a giant hole in the water heater closet because they did such a shitty job sealing things when they ""remodeled"" the apartment) so when we saw the material all over the floor and my dog licking the floor, we had to take him to the emergency vet and pay $700 to make sure he\'d be okay. Hawthorne refused to reimburse even though they were the ones who hired the negligent 3rd party. The pest tech had said everything was clean and safe for our dogs and that nothing was within reach of them. He was wrong as he had spilled it all over the floor in the kitchen. When we had a mold problem in the bathroom because the fan is useless, it took putting in a work order multiple times before they actually came and fixed it. We had a wasp nest in the wood by our sliding glass door and it took them two months to get someone out to remove it. Every single year when we\'ve renewed our lease they charge us for the rent insurance even though I always send a copy of my 3rd party insurance to the office and leasing manager  right after signing the new lease. Because they don\'t check my emails to them. They wait until multiple washers and dryers are broken before calling a tech to come fix them so sometimes there\'s only 3 or 4 working machines at a time. When my car was broken into in their parking lot, they didn\'t even respond to my email asking them if there\'s anything the apartment complex could do to help. (Check cameras, etc.). Pre-hurricane during a different storm one of the trees near us partially fell. Their version of fixing the hazard (if it fell completely it\'d be in the road) was to put caution tape around the branches and then never touch it again. They\'re the worst apartment complex I\'ve ever lived at. The only reason I haven\'t moved out is because of their stupid lease. They require a 30 day notice which is fine and standard, but if you wait less than 60 days before the lease is up to sign your new lease then they charge $200 more per month instead of $100 more per month. They call it an ""early bird"" special when in reality its predatory AF. So we\'re basically stuck unless we want to take the chance of finding a new place in less than 30 days in an economy where housing is extremely hard to find.

Helene Thru The Eyes of a 8 Year Old- 

My mom woke me up early, because all the water came inside our house. 

I could hear like a hurricane outside, and the trees breaking. My mom said that we had to leave, but I didn‚Äôt want to leave, because all my stuff is in my room. 

I could see water in my room, and it was cold, and lots of my stuff started floating in the water. Then we looked outside, and other people were running around, and some people were on top of their house.

We took our cat and ran to our car and drove on a road, but half of it was disappeared. And then we slept in a parking lot. 

Then lots of army people came by to check on us and brought us water and food, and blankets, and said that they needed to check on other families, because things were really bad.

Then other families in the USA learned about what happened here & they put all of their stuff in trucks to bring to us because they wanted to help us. 

They drive here from far away, and their kids slept in their truck on the drive here, but they wanted to come here to help us because some people are really good and love us and they brought us lots of stuff we needed. 

They brought us food, blankets, water in bottles, batteries and generator stuff. and they didn‚Äôt even want any money, they just gave it to us to help us because they love us. 

We have a new house now. I miss my friends. I‚Äôm going to a new school.

That was far from my first hurricane and far from my last and, honestly, experiencing Helene as a 32 year old has taken more of a toll than Katrina as a kid.

Asheville is open to tourists again??! Wtf NatGeo,"Read [this article](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/asheville-hurricane-helene-tourism-industry) published yesterday (10/25/24) on NatGeo's website, and I am in shock. Apparently, Asheville is open to tourists again...

HIGHWAYS

I-26 south past 40 is supposed to be clear all the way to SC. Reports of gas available past the mountain. Gas available in Gastonia. Other reports of no gas until Shelby. Report of multiple people making it to Charlotte

Reddit comments:

We left this morning on 26 towards shelby/gastonia. We had 1/4 tank of gas and just made it to Gastonia where we were able to fill up. Most stations before then were either not open or had pretty long lines. Unsure if the situation has changed since this morning.

I have friends who left by that route this afternoon. They had a nearly full tank and 100 miles into SC there were still very long lines at stations that had gas. I would tell him not to try it until he can fill his tank up in Asheville. Maybe wait another day or two. Would be terrible to get stranded.

As of ~3PM you can take 40W to 74S to Franklin where there is gas available. From there cell service is consistent across the GA line near Clayton.

Any suggestions for a small trip out of AVL,"my fianc√© and i are depressed, naturally, and still struggling to figure out what to do next with our lives since we've been so uprooted and felt really lost after losing our jobs from helene and everything going on in AVL... we want to go on a small relatively cheap trip somewhere around the area (within a 5 hr drive preferably). anyone have suggestions for cities that we can visit that haven't been badly impacted by the hurricane and we won't be imposing by staying in a hotel somewhere that a displaced family may need it. we just want to get out of the city for a few days to try and refresh and are lucky enough to have the finances to do something small. i'm not very familiar with the east coast as ive only lived here for a year and i'm from the PNW so any suggestions are good suggestions! thank you

You can walk around the area for free; exhibits are ticketed.)\n\n\\- Bethabara (Older Moravian settlement on the north side. Smaller than Old Salem but still some cool, preserved structures from the 1700s. You can take paid, guided tours of buildings/exhibits for a few bucks. But there are also walking trails and the greenway that you can do for free.)\n\n\\- Reynolda House & Gardens (RJ Reynolds' arts and crafts-style mansion from the early 1900s. The gardens and walking trails are open to the public and are free to explore; the house museum has a good art collection and is ticketed.)\n\n\\- Reynolda Village (Old barns and outbuildings adjacent to the Reynolda property that have been turned into cafes and shops, including a really nice small bookstore/coffee place.)\n\n\\- NC Museum of Art Winston-Salem (Small-ish contemporary/avant-garde art museum, half in a historic mansion/half in a modernist building. Ticketed.)\n\n\\- NC School of the Arts (Usually lots of ongoing exhibits and performances. Check their website https://www.uncsa.edu/)\n\n\\- Downtown Winston (Urban walkable area with galleries, cafes, shops, and public spaces, mostly centered around 4th and Trade Streets. Also, a few blocks east of downtown along Patterson Ave is the Innovation Quarter, which is a renovated industrial district with a park, shops, and cafes. Occasionally they have an outdoor flea market with vendors and live music, too.)\n\n\\- Wineries (If you like wine, there are a dozen+ wineries about 20-30 minutes west of W-S along the I-77 and US 421 corridors that have tasting rooms and tours.)\n\nThere are a couple of cool hotels downtown. If you have it in your budget to treat yourself a little, there's the Kimpton Cardinal in the old RJ Reynolds art deco skyscraper. There's also a Hotel Indigo a few blocks from the Cardinal.

Spectrum apologizes and says we will get credit on bill for outage. ,"Here‚Äôs the full text:

Update on Hurricane Helene Progress
Hello [name],
Hurricane Helene has been devastating to Asheville and the recovery has been challenging, taking longer than we initially anticipated. Damage to hundreds of miles of our network, our inability to safely access certain areas, and the need to return to make repairs in areas where infrastructure needs to be rebuilt before we can begin restoring our network has contributed to these delays.
 
Our technicians, who live and work in these same neighborhoods, along with the additional 700 technicians who traveled from around the country to assist our local teams, are working tirelessly around-the-clock to get this work done.
 
At the same time, I want to acknowledge the executive team - not our technicians - dropped the ball and I understand your frustration. We should have been more transparent; with more timely and detailed communications regarding what we were seeing on-the-ground, the extensive work that will be needed to repair our network, and timelines for the work.
 
In the past few days, we have begun providing regular county level updates on our progress (available on Spectrum.net/Helene), including expected completion dates to homes and businesses that are accessible to our crews. There is still a long road and much work ahead, but we will continue to share updates throughout.
 
Based on what we have learned in your area, we have already implemented new emergency communication protocols for responding to these types of events. Some of those improvements have already been put in place for Hurricane Milton in Florida.
 
We value and greatly appreciate your business and your candid feedback. Once we have restored your service, we will automatically apply the appropriate credit to your next bill for the time your service was down ‚Äì no action is required by you to receive your credit. Our intention is always to do the right thing.
 
We must and will do better to earn your continued trust.
 
Thank you again for your patience and being our customer.
 

Cliff Hagan
Executive Vice President, Customer Operations

How to get FEMA disaster relief ($),"EDIT: I do not have any additional info. If you have a question, please call the #. They are answering phones.

Apparently you can get $ in 2-3 days if you have your direct deposit info

(from NC Department of Insurance)

FEMA has declared Individual Assistance (IA) for Hurricane Helene. What does this mean for you? It means that you can apply for disaster assistance from FEMA to help offset your disaster-related expenses.  You can apply online at https://www.disasterassistance.gov/ or by telephone at (800) 621-3362. Otherwise, you can download the FEMA weather app from Google PlayStore or the Apple Store and you can apply for assistance on the app and upload receipts. Whichever method you choose, the form has a few questions that are tricky. To avoid delay, please follow the following tips:

1.     One of the questions that FEMA will ask when you register is ‚ÄúDo You Have Emergency Needs‚Äù? This means during your evacuation or since staying at home during the disaster, do you need help with Gas, Medication, Food (meals, water, had no power and everything spoils), Shelter (you are staying with friends, family or in a hotel); Clothing; or Durable Medical Equipment (oxygen, walkers, cane, glasses, all major equipment, etc). If this is true, say ‚ÄúYES‚Äù to this question. That will result in your receiving Displacement / Critical Needs Assistance, which is $750.

2.      When asked if your home is/was accessible, answer ""NO"" if there was debris, tree branches, continued flooding, loss of power, damage or destruction that prevented you from staying there after Helene. This question is asking whether you can stay at your home or apartment and will trigger the ability for you to receive assistance to pay for hotels or provide funding to use while you stay with family or friends.

3.      When asked if utilities are out, say ""YES"" even if your utilities were out for a few days. This triggers assistance $ to stay somewhere other than your home or to buy fuel to power a generator.

4.       When asked ‚ÄúAre you willing to relocate‚Äù say ""YES"" if you cannot live in your home due to damage, loss of power, etc. This question means you are willing to stay in a hotel or apartment temporarily, and triggers that funding for you. It is not asking if you are willing to move away from your home permanently.

5.      If you bought or buy a generator, FEMA will reimburse you up to $629, but you must submit the receipt. If you bought a chainsaw, FEMA will reimburse you up to $219. Again, you need to provide the receipt. Save your receipts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/asheville/comments/1fu51ko/how_to_get_fema_disaster_relief/,1727833519.0,SpuddyBud,asheville,"[{'Comment Author': 'lotus_22', 'Comment Body': 'I didn‚Äôt understand the website.

FEMA priority are family structures that have been judged major or destroyed. Major is defined as more than one structural failure in essential living space. That does not include garage or porch or out buildings. Destroyed is just that. Also there is a category when completing a damage assessment is ""uninhabitable"" which basically means it is unsafe to live in the house.\n\nIf you receive a rejection read the notice carefully. Often times if you have insurance FEMA will reject the application but the fine print will ask you to refile the claim once you insurance mak essential a determination.\n\nNote these funds are meant to provide assistance not make whole you loss. \n\nIf possible file everywhere you can. United Way, American Red Cross, ect.\n\nWithin the next two weeks you will begin to see MARCs set up. These are multiple agency resource centers. Typically these will include FEMA, American Red Cross, United Way, and others in a single place that allow you to move from table to table.\n\nIn Guam and Maui MARCs also included state and the FBI to reissue drivers license and 1 day passports. Those services may not be available immediately.\n\nIn my experience the first two weeks are the most difficult as logistics are established and distribution centers are aggregated.\n\nAs an aside go by World Central Kitchen and if u don\'t need the food (which is always great).

**Tom Hardy, Gen Manager of Metropolitan Sewage District (MSD)**

Had to use back up generators immediately after storm, but plant was high and did not flood, and working on regular power now.

All major lines (interceptors) are working and all 40 of our pump stations are online. Several are on back up power, and we will need repairs on electrical panels.

Check your own plumbing lines for damage from trees just in case, but you are good to use the sewage system if you have water.

Starting this morning we opened the admin building for business on Riverside dr. 828.768.0540 if you have a sewer emergency call this cell number.

Something about cross seams, and said people were checking them and fixing them.

We‚Äôve had relief workers making sure our local staff got a reprieve.

**Marianne Tierney ‚Äì FEMA**

¬†

**Dr. Richardson? Chief Medical Officer**

(he is \*so\* hard to hear as well but they fix it halfway through)

This is an ongoing trauma we‚Äôve all suffered. Steps to consider

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Connect with loved ones. Friends, family, and others who have been displaced. Don‚Äôt be afraid to share, listen to others.

2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Stay Informed but make sure to take breaks. Staying online constantly isn‚Äôt the most effective way to process.

3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Try to create a regular routine in whatever way looks effective now. Eat, Sleep, and form of Exercise, Meditating, Reading, Connecting with others, Deep Breathing. Take time to do what you can to mitigate stress. It‚Äôs all helpful.

4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Signs to take extra care: feeling anger, fear, sadness, worry, frustration, and it‚Äôs affecting your functioning on a day to day basis, or your behaviours like youre arguing more or thoughts of suicide, or a worsening of your previous illness, it is time to reach out for more specific help. All our patterns are changed, and it‚Äôs normal to experience that, headaches, gastrointestinal disturbances, difficulty thinking and processing, are all normal, but when it gets bad it‚Äôs okay to address it.

5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Checking on children because their patterns and regular routines are disrupted. So try to listen, be open to what they‚Äôre expressing and what their fears are, and remember to talk with them in a way that‚Äôs appropriate for their developmental age. Calmness, reassuring them is good, and some explanation is good but don‚Äôt overwhelm. Older kids being straightforward and honest is ideal though. Role modeling resiliency will help them cope this trauma and be a model for how to cope with traumas in the future.

6.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Many of our Elders are isolated regularly, so try to check in more with our Elders. Get them water, food, supplies, help them get to medical appointments, etc.

7.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Those with Chronic Medical Conditions ‚Äì same thing as Elders. And reminder about the pharmacy thing from Marianne.

Shout out to mental health services in the shelters, local on the grounds needs, and telehealth opportunities, including providers around the state.

-tomorrow will be an update from City of Asheville about the water. We will address those questions tomorrow.

¬†

**Media Q + A**

**Q:** (Andrew Jones, AVL Watchdog) Any preparation health department is planning for regarding water system being out?  
A: Yes. Public Health Director and our Medical Director are working on preparations in this vein. No further info right now, but the public health ramifications of this disaster are not an afterthought. Those comfort stations are going to be a big help. Reminder to donate hand sanitizer and use it.

Q: Will you be coordinating with the hospital?  
A: Yes.

Q: (USA Today) Supplies being delivered to vulnerable people needed?  
A: Water, water for flushing, MREs, cleaning supplies, disinfectant, hand sanitizer.

Q: (Laura Lee BPR) How can people request these services if they can‚Äôt get out?  
A: We are going through the community and doing assessments. They can make those requests during welfare checks, through the United Way, or calling 911 dispatch. Best way: 828.250.6100 . This call center will get you in contact with the right people.

Q: (Health News‚Ä¶? Missed who this is) Wells need to be tested, rough count for how many have called in for tests, is FEMA helping with this?  
A: No firm number. People are actively being deployed for testing. ¬†We will get that number back to you. FEMA, EPA or others will only get involved if any of those results come back and show we need them to be involved. (no news is goods news)

Q: (Craig/Greg Fuller?) EPA is on site conducting testing? Is there a timeline for knowing when volunteers can help clean along the riverbanks?  
A: I know they‚Äôre on the ground in WNC, but not positive what their position is specifically. When we know we will share info on the status.  
Q: So they haven‚Äôt briefed Buncombe County on anything they‚Äôve found?  
A: No, but we will follow up.

Q: (clarifying FB chat) 58k in Buncombe County who are serviced by Duke. Originally 149k w/o power.

Q: (Charles ) Cease & Desist letter put out to restaurants in the area to not resume operations till inspected and get ‚Äòre-permitted‚Äô. Concerns on reopening? Inspector numbers? Repurcutions for those who open up and operate anyways.  
A: 15 inspectors working every day, so about 10 out at any time. Need to make sure they‚Äôre reopening safety. Please call us if you get that letter, we want you open too, so let‚Äôs get it processed as fast as possible. We just need everyone to follow the necessary precautions for safety and prosperity.

Q: (Greg Parley again? Lol what is this name!) Internet‚Ä¶.?  
A: Fiber was significantly impacted kinda like the water lines. We‚Äôre gonna follow up on this and we acknowledge the impact.

Q: (Will?) Burning guidelines were given. Are we concerned about air quality issues with lots of burns?  
A: If it grows, it goes. If it‚Äôs not something that naturally grows in our community please don‚Äôt burn it. We will be going through and collecting debris, we want it out too, but don‚Äôt burn that debris that‚Äôs not natural (including treated and painted wood). 15ft away, and no larger than 3ft piles.  
Q: Any sense of how much debris you‚Äôre looking at in the area?  
A: Nothing firm. Debris collection will not cost. Pender: we will be coming through every secondary rd, the debris contractor is clear but he‚Äôs working on getting the roads cleared for it. We want to make sure the neighborhoods can know he‚Äôs coming to get stuff. But it will only be pulled from curbs and public right of ways. We don‚Äôt want stuff to pile up and block roadways so we will communicate when it‚Äôs happening so you can pull everything from back, side, and front yards for collection.

Q: (Laura Lee) Oxygen refills. Some of those lists had corrections?  
A: list on [buncombeready.org](http://buncombeready.org) will be the correct list. It changes frequently but they‚Äôll stay on top of it.

Q: (Greg) Restaurants, when health dept is clearing to open, is there a specific notice the public should look out for proof. Are restaurants permitted to give away food prior to health dept review.  
A: They can give it away for free. There‚Äôs no plan for public notice about it.

"Remaining challenges with fixing our water system - still likely ""weeks away"" from full restoration","Here's a quick update on the AVL water situation that I've gleaned from the daily Buncombe County briefings over the last few days.

They have now repaired and reconnected the main (bypass) line from the North Fork reservoir that provides 80% of AVL/Buncombe water supply. This is just the first step in restoring water. There are two major challenges remaining:

1: Significant ""turbidity"" in the main reservoir has stirred up all the mud and silt in the water, and it's currently too dirty to filter. They need to wait for the mud to settle out of the water, otherwise it will break their filtering systems. This is a natural process, although they are trying to speed it along.

2: Breakages in the distribution system means that once they start to pump treated water into the system (after the turbidity settles), they'll then be able to identify and fix leaks. There are 1,800 miles of pipes, and probably hundreds of leaks, so this process will take a while.

In addition to filling 1800 miles of water lines, they also need to refill 42 water storage tanks. 

Once the leaks are fixed, they will also need to test water to ensure it's safe to drink.

Overall, we're still weeks away from water restoration for most locations.

Please note that I don't have any further information other than what I shared above, based on the daily briefings and the efforts of a Hurricane Helene Recovery mod on the discord server.

I'll post links to those in the comments.",https://www.reddit.com/r/asheville/comments/1g0metn/remaining_challenges_with_fixing_our_water_system/,1728576581.0,paul_caspian,asheville,"[{'Comment Author': 'AutoModerator', 'Comment Body': 'Hey u/paul_caspian, it looks like you asking or commenting about the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.

One, the amount needed would be enormous and very difficult to procure. Two, flocculants require mixing to come in contact with the suspended particles which would be extremely difficult to accomplish in a massive body of water. Three, flocculants generally work best within a specific pH range and it‚Äôs very likely the pH would need to be adjusted with chemical addition (typically NaOH), which would have major ecological effects within the reservoir. To sum it up, that‚Äôs why these processes are best accomplished within the treatment facility itself using flash mixing tanks ‚û°Ô∏è coagulation/flocculation basins ‚û°Ô∏è sedimentation basin ‚û°Ô∏è filtration ‚û°Ô∏è disinfection. The crux here seems to be that the water treatment facility just wasn‚Äôt designed to handle the level of turbidity in the raw water that is being seen right now and it would cause more harm on the facility to push its limits than it would do good.\n\nEdit: Per a plant spotlight article from the NC water industry association, NC One Water, the North Fork WTP does not have sedimentation basins between flocculation and filtration which would protect the filters from excessively sediment laden raw water like this. Therefore, the WTP truly can‚Äôt handle this much sediment in its present state without allowing it to settle some in the reservoir. The good news is that we are not expecting any major weather systems in the 10-day forecast which will help limit disturbance in the reservoir and speed up settling.'}, {'Comment Author': 'KingMe091', 'Comment Body': ""Theres got to be something like that out there?

In essence what I‚Äôve understood from the briefing summaries I just read, they are partitioning off a portion of the reservoir with curtains to create smaller settling zones to limit the amount of flocculant and other chemicals they may need for pH adjustment in order to quickly reduce the sediment in the reservoir water. This is basically the same thing we do with sedimentation basins in most surface water treatment facilities that have them, just they are doing this in the reservoir since this facility doesn‚Äôt have sedimentation basins. Now it seems that they will be pumping directly from these clarified zones of the reservoir, then heavily chlorinating it and pumping it into the distribution system immediately without filtering. I‚Äôm not clear on why they can‚Äôt run the clarified water through the water treatment facility instead of bypassing it (didn‚Äôt have the time to do a deep dive here) but I suspect it is due to either some equipment failures at the plant or the plant still doesn‚Äôt have power either of which are highly likely. Regardless, this will help get water in the system to find leaks while issues at the plant are getting sorted out and gets water to people to use for flushing, washing clothes, etc. It‚Äôs certainly not a perfect or best case situation though because the unfiltered water will have some sediment in it still that can damage critical home plumbing components and appliances, so people should shut off water to major appliances like water heaters and dish washers. I‚Äôd also go ahead and remove aerators on your faucets to keep them from clogging. Also, the unfiltered water will have much higher organic content in it than usual and I would strongly suspect heavily chlorinating it will result in the formation of disinfection byproducts in excess of EPA drinking water standards. Finally, they will need to heavily flush the entire system as much as possible once regular treatment capacity returns and they will have a massive sampling effort to undertake to determine when the boil water advisory can be lifted. You must boil the water vigorously if you intend to consume it, and I would try to avoid consuming it if possible until regular treatment capacity including filtration has returned.

BCS Educator Vent Post: It‚Äôs a long one,"Before I vent I want to state that I am completely for schools re-opening and kids who are ready being able to get back to some normalcy. 

My frustration is the lack of support for BCS staff to be able to accomplish this by next Wednesday. At my school alone I‚Äôve had several teachers lose their homes or have substantial damage that has forced them to relocate for the foreseeable future. Teachers have lost family and friends that they are grieving for. Many have lost childcare for their non-school aged children.

As staff we were all asked to submit a readiness survey with what our housing situation was, access to water/power, and childcare needs. Today at the meeting the superintendent stated that there were about 400ish staff members in critical need situations. To support those staff members he said to reach out to their principals if they can‚Äôt make the two teacher workdays. No mention of possible temporary childcare solutions or temporary leave options for teachers in critical status. They are bringing in extra counselors to be available to us. Some of us are just trying to survive we do not need to talk we need action, more time to recover, and solutions for childcare. BCS can hire fire watchers at schools but not extra people for childcare? 
Educators are responsible for meeting the emotional/physical needs of 20 plus students when our own needs aren‚Äôt being met. 

Maybe some of us not returning will be what it takes for them to realize we are also people living in this community during the disaster. We love our students and it breaks my heart to think I‚Äôll have to leave them during such a difficult time. 

During hurricane Florence schools were closed for 8 weeks and the impact was not as devastating as Helene. We could have come up with creative solutions that provided full day care and tutoring for working parents in a more limited capacity until we were better prepared. Instead the district is forcing the already understaffed schools to lose more teachers. 

The whole situation sucks. Even if I lose my job I know I am fortunate to have my family and a roof over our heads. I‚Äôm just having a pity party and offering my perspective. I will say that the majority of families and the community have been great advocates to teachers during this time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/asheville/comments/1g75c2t/bcs_educator_vent_post_its_a_long_one/,1729330731.0,Alternative-Ad8456,asheville,"[{'Comment Author': 'AutoModerator', 'Comment Body': 'Hey u/Alternative-Ad8456, it looks like you asking or commenting about the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.

How did no one predict Helene  would hit this hard inland?,"Genuinely asking because I don‚Äôt have all the information. At first it sounded like the theory was the water was from a broken dam, but that was disproved. So‚Ä¶ if this flooding was from a hurricane, how did weather services not predict this? Did weather services miscalculate the amount of rain or momentum in the storm? Was this truly just an absolutely MASSIVE storm that was bigger than even Katrina and ones that came before it? 

I‚Äôm asking bc in the big picture, people need to start reconsidering how huge storms like this will impact them. Inland cities in NC, VA, KY, TN, WV are no longer safe from hurricanes‚Ä¶.

Unfortunately, nobody could predict that it was going be so much more rain than the 8-11‚Äù, until Helene made landfall on the 26th. At that point the forecast and warnings were revised.

Accessing Schedule II Prescription Meds during Helene,"I was able to get my own schedule II prescription filled, but it was difficult to find information relevant for those of us with prescriptions for controlled substances. Here is what I found so far. I tried to post this on the main Resources thread but the comment would not post, so I made a separate post. I am not a medical professional- if this information is incorrect or should be updated, **please** reach out and I will make edits.

**TLDR (to the best of my ability):**

* You need a valid prescription for scheduled substances. Unlike other medications, you cannot just show up at an emergency pharmacy and get a refill
* If you are unable to get in touch with your provider and need a prescription, the easiest thing (for insurance reasons) is to go to an urgent care and have the provider prescribe an emergency refill. Bring an old prescription bottle, information from your patient portal (if accessible- take screenshots if you can just in case), and any other documentation you can that is relevant to your prescription
* If a pharmacy has your prescription but that pharmacy is not operational, one of the operational emergency pharmacies SHOULD be able to transfer your prescription. Not all of the pharmacies dispense controlled substances- call and check first
* It may be possible to pick up your scheduled meds early but you might get a smaller amount than usual
* Controlled substances must be picked up by the person they are prescribed to. Bring your ID (as usual)
* Normally, scheduled substances require an electronic prescription but because of Helene that might not be possible. Paper prescriptions ARE ALLOWED under the circumstances.
* If for some reason your doctor is unable to write you a paper or electronic prescription, but they can call the pharmacy on the phone, the pharmacy can fill your prescription if they can reasonably verify that your doctor is actually a doctor who can prescribe medication
* Call the emergency pharmacies to check if they have your prescription in stock before you transfer your prescription
* Until November 3 2024, pharmacists can fill an emergency 90 day prescription refill for schedule III, IV, and V medications, including buprenorphine. The deadline could be extended but for now it is November 3. 

**SUBOXONE INFORMATION**

* MAT (suboxone) can be filled through Walgreens. EMS was on a call with them this morning and it has been verified that a previous bottle is enough for a bridge Rx. Not all locations have power or may not have recieved the update.
* Folks who are withdrawing from Suboxone or want to start a sub Rx for any reason should reach out to the Buncombe County Community Paramedics at 828-772-1294

**URGENT CARE SERVICES**

Mercy Urgent Care has walk-in locations open at the following addresses from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.:

* West Asheville: 1201 Patton Ave.
* Weaverville: 61 Weaver Blvd.
* Brevard: 22 Trust Lane
* Waynesville: 120 Frazier St.
* Foothills: 140 W Mills St.

Novant Go-Health Urgent Care, 349 New Leicester Highway, is open from 9 a.m.-6 p.m.

FEMA has doctors stationed at Mission hospital outside the ambulance bays (outside of ER) who are writing rxs for emergency supplies.

>Emergency rules allow people to go to any open pharmacy with their prescription bottles to get a 30- or 90-day refill on their medications.

>You do not need to go to the typical place you go to fill your prescriptions.

>These rules also allow the pharmacy to refill the prescription even if there are no remaining refills indicated.

>*These types of emergency refill procedures cannot be used to fill prescriptions for Schedule II controlled substances which include pain medications containing hydrocodone or oxycodone and ADHD medications like Adderall and Ritalin.*

>All health insurance plans that are licensed to operate in the state are legally responsible to allow and cover prescriptions that are otherwise being filled ‚Äútoo soon‚Äù by people who reside in an area that is subject to an emergency declaration.

>It is okay for someone other than the patient to pick up the prescription. Some medications may require the person picking up the medication to have a copy of the patient‚Äôs ID, but this is not the case for most medications.

>Mission Hospital‚Äôs Outpatient Pharmacy at 509 Biltmore Ave., Entrance #4, is open 24/7 to fill prescriptions. They close for lunch from noon to 1 p.m. daily. *They are not filling prescriptions for controlled substances.*

**Info from PardeeBlue MD**:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/asheville/comments/1ftvads/emergency\_prescription\_refills/](https://www.reddit.com/r/asheville/comments/1ftvads/emergency_prescription_refills/)

u/fistula shared that PardeeBlue MD is doing emergency prescription refills FOR FREE for the community- see thread for details. I asked some questions specific to Schedule II prescriptions:

>Q: If someone needs schedule II meds, can you write a prescription for those drugs?

>A: If they are unable to reach their provider/need more refills, the best thing to do would be go to an urgent care and have the provider there prescribe the emergency refill. My office does have availability but they would have to establish with a whole new provider which can get messy with insurance

>Q: What kind of information do you need to write a prescription- old pill bottles? Name of usual provider?

>A: An old bottle is perfect! A patient portal is also wonderful too!

>Q: Can you fill those prescriptions at your pharmacy? I know the hospital pharmacy will not fill schedule II prescriptions

>A: Yes we can!

>Q: Could someone pick up a scheduled prescription for schedule II drugs early?

>A: Possibly! Especially given the circumstances. It will most likely be a very short term prescription but it‚Äôs medication regardless

>Q: Can someone else pick them up? If so what do they need- copy of photo id?

>A: Unfortunately for schedule II drugs, it would have to be the one who is being prescribed the meds to get them. Normally you‚Äôd just need their date of birth, but because of laws and stuff it has to be the person it was prescribed to

>Q: If a prescription was sent into a pharmacy but the pharmacy is not operational, is it possible to transfer that prescription to a different pharmacy? If it can't be transferred, is it possible to get a new prescription and cancel the old one?

>A: Yes it can be transferred! That‚Äôs an easy process

>u/fistula says: Please feel free to reach out to me directly if you have any more questions! Meds and insurance and everything are already confusing under normal circumstances let alone all this. Stay safe and stay strong my friend

**Update from the NC Board of Pharmacies:**

[https://www.ncbop.org/heleneaftermath.html](https://www.ncbop.org/heleneaftermath.html)

Relevant to people with prescriptions for controlled substances (might be useful to have on your phone to remind your pharmacist):

>CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE PRESCRIPTION FORMATS

>The North Carolina STOP Act requires that prescriptions for ‚Äútargeted controlled substances‚Äù to be transmitted electronically unless an exception applies. One exception is ‚Äútechnical failure or other circumstance preventing electronic transmission.‚Äù For obvious reasons, transmission or receipt of electronic prescriptions in Helene-affected counties is likely to be problematic. Accordingly, the STOP Act‚Äôs electronic transmission provisions are not a reason to decline filling a controlled substance prescription issued for a legitimate medical purpose in the ordinary course of medical practice. More STOP Act information is found here:[ https://www.ncbop.org/downloads/GuidanceImplementationSTOPACTUpdatedJune2023.pdf](https://www.ncbop.org/downloads/GuidanceImplementationSTOPACTUpdatedJune2023.pdf)

>Pharmacists are also reminded that, in the case of an ‚Äúemergency situation,‚Äù federal law (21 CFR 1306.11(d)) allows a pharmacist to dispense a Schedule II controlled substance upon receiving oral authorization from the prescriber, provided that: (1) the amount is limited to that adequate to treat the patient during the emergency period; (2) the prescription is immediately reduced to writing by the pharmacist; (3) if the prescriber is no known to the pharmacist, the pharmacist makes a reasonable effort to determine the oral authorization came from a DEA-registered prescriber; and (4) within 7 days, the prescriber causes a written prescription to be delivered to the dispensing pharmacist.

**DEA Exception Letter for Schedule III, IV, and V Controlled Substances, Including Buprenorphine**

[https://canons.sog.unc.edu/2024/10/hurricane-helene-rx/](https://canons.sog.unc.edu/2024/10/hurricane-helene-rx/)

>The DEA has issued an exception letter clarifying that 21 N.C.A.C. 46 .1815, North Carolina‚Äôs administrative rule governing emergency prescription refills when medical services are interrupted, may be used to create and dispense one-time, 90-day supply emergency refills of Schedule III, Schedule IV, and Schedule V controlled substances. This is particularly important for patients with a prescription for buprenorphine, which is a Schedule III drug that is used in the treatment of opioid use disorders. This exception is in effect for 30 days (until November 3, 2024) unless the DEA issues an extension. Pharmacists with questions about the implementation of this exception should contact the BOP.

On my way to Asheville this weekend,"Mom and dad live in Oakley and were very fortunate to not have lost their home or experience severe flooding atleast where they live anyways. Dad says his pup won‚Äôt use the bathroom like he used to and has been having accidents and my dad really think it may have something to do with the smell in Asheville as we know dogs noses are far more sensitive and can smell for miles‚Ä¶ eerie thought. With that being said I‚Äôm an Asheville native living in Florida and I could not wait to just get up there to hug my parents and be with them for the short 72 hours I‚Äôm there. I‚Äôve managed to raise some money (not much) and get clothing and blanket donations to bring with me. With money raised I‚Äôve purchased boot and hand warmers already had those sent to a wonderful lady who‚Äôs been a part of so many operations in regards to getting people things they need. She helped my parents and ever since we‚Äôve become quite close. Great woman of Oakley. I hope to see more clothing donations this week before I leave on Friday. When it comes to money donations besides toe and hand warmers what are other things you notice that could be very useful for those sleeping in tents during these freezing temps? Anything I can buy in bulk is great so any suggestions are greatly appreciated. If you have someone there you know needs immediate help or families with children please  comment below and let me see if I can help. I have a toddler myself so it‚Äôs really been getting to me imagining the suffering and loss of these babies- but I mean anyone who‚Äôs been taken from this unforeseen tradegy , my heart goes out to each and every one of you.

"Buncombe County Helene Recovery Update 10/22 12:40pm: County Offices Reopening, NCDMV Updates & Restaurant Re-Opening Plans","Good Afternoon Ashevillians! I am posting today's Buncombe County official update for those who are not receiving the emails. I got the date wrong in my last post, so I have triple checked this one. Timestamped information is particularly important right now with updates and changes being made regularly. Also, I 'd like to say that seeing members of our community reach out for help and seeing others step up to support them daily continues to be very heartwarming. We will make it through this!

I have tried to add some quick formatting and headers to make the update easier to read, since they sent it mostly unformatted. Here is the full text:

# County Reopening

On Wednesday, Oct. 23, Buncombe County will reopen to the public during regular business hours with the exception of most parks and two libraries. Only North Buncombe Fields and Hominy Valley Park will open; all other parks remain closed. All libraries will open with the exception of Oakley/South Asheville Library and Swannanoa Library.

# Solid Waste¬†

This week, WastePro is running normal routes for trash and recycling where accessible.¬†

The landfill is open at 85 Panther Road in Alexander on Monday through Friday from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. The Transfer Station at 190 Hominy Creek Road in Asheville is open 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. This is for residential bagged trash and household recycling. Regular fees apply.¬†

Recycling can be dropped off at Curbside Management, 116 N. Woodfin Ave., Asheville, Monday-Friday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. There is a drop-off area just inside the gate.¬†

# D-SNAP¬†

Buncombe County residents can apply for help buying food through the Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP). The deadline to apply is in two days ‚Äì Thursday. Individuals and households not currently receiving Food and Nutrition Services benefits who were impacted by Hurricane Helene can apply for D-SNAP. Applications can be submitted in-person at Buncombe County Health and Human Services at 40 Coxe Avenue in Asheville from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. The application process can also be started online by pre-registering at¬†[epass.nc.gov](http://epass.nc.gov/)¬†and then calling the DSNAP Call Center at 1-844-453-1117.¬†

# Donations¬†

Due to the incredible outpouring of support, organizations throughout Buncombe County have received an influx of donations like clothes, shoes and blankets. We can‚Äôt accept any more, because we simply don‚Äôt have the resources available to store and distribute them. We encourage anyone who wants to assist to make financial contributions to reputable organizations supporting Helene recovery.¬†

The sentiment extends to volunteers, as well. We have a strong presence from FEMA and emergency response teams from across the state and around the country. The county doesn‚Äôt have opportunities available right now for volunteers to work outside of the emergency response structure. We want to respect people‚Äôs time and energy, so we gently ask that they only come here if government agencies request their presence or if they have pre-arranged opportunities with community organizations.¬†

# N.C. Department of Motor Vehicles¬†

At its peak, 25 driver license offices and 28 license plate agencies in Western North Carolina closed due to impacts from the storm. Currently, there are only a few driver license offices closed, one at Burnsville and another at Spruce Pine.¬†

All WNC license plates agencies have reopened except for Marshall, which suffered extensive damage.¬†

**Some updates:**  

Open driver license offices are now designated as credential pick-up centers.¬†

If your license or ID card cannot be delivered by mail, you can return to the location of your in-person transaction after 21 days to pick up your credential.¬†

If you complete (or completed) your renewal or ordered a duplicate online, or at an office that hasn‚Äôt yet reopened, please visit¬†[ncdmv.gov](http://ncdmv.gov/)¬†to see where your credential can be picked up. Allow at least 21 days from the date of your transaction to see if it can be delivered to your home or for it to arrive at the designated office for pickup.¬†

All these details can be found at¬†[ncdot.gov/WNCcredentialPickup](http://ncdot.gov/WNCcredentialPickup).¬†

The DMV License and Theft Bureau, the DMV‚Äôs law enforcement arm, assisted 17 law enforcement support requests as a part of this recovery effort, including deployment of 121 personnel to WNC.¬†

# Home Well Testing¬†

During Hurricane Helene recovery, Environmental Health has received 900 water sample applications. While most of these wells were not directly affected by flood water or damaged by the hurricane, these water sample applications have provided peace of mind for those relying on wells for drinking water.¬†

Environmental Health will now be focusing on flooded or damaged wells due to the storm. Starting today, Environmental health will shift to only sampling wells that were flooded or damaged during the storm. The office will screen water sample applications to determine if the well was flooded or damaged. For the wells that meet this criteria, well disinfection kits and water sample collection kits will be provided.¬†

Environmental Health highly recommends residents to only apply for a well water test if their well was flooded or damaged. If the well was not flooded or damaged, residents should consider waiting to submit applications for a water sample. This will allow the office to prioritize our recovery and response activities to help those in our community most impacted by the storm.¬†

# Restaurant Re-Opening¬†

To help food service establishments reopen as quickly and safely as possible, Buncombe County Environmental Health launched a new, streamlined ‚ÄúEmergency Operations Plan for Food Establishments‚Äù form operators can complete and submit online at¬†[buncombecounty.org/eh](http://buncombecounty.org/eh).¬†

Environmental Health has processed and approved 276 streamlined Emergency Operation Plans for Food Establishments since Thursday of last week.¬†

Environmental Health is also working with the Division of Child Development and Early Education to assist childcare centers with reopening. Forty-two Emergency Operation Plans have been received for childcare centers; 40 of them have been reviewed, and 32 plans can be approved. Approved plans are shared with the licensed childcare consultant responsible for completing the final review. After the final review, Environmental Health will make a site visit to complete the reopening process.¬†

"Buncombe County Helene Recovery Update 10/14 3pm: Water Updates, FEMA Assistance Sites & Debris Pickup Guidelines","Hey friends! I keep reading that people aren't getting all of the official updates, so I'm posting the update emailed out around 10 minutes ago. Stay safe! Stay strong!

Here is the full text:

To help schools re-open, there will be changes to the food and water distribution sites soon. The Lucy Herring Elementary distribution site will close at 7 p.m. on Monday and will be relocated to 980 Brevard Road (former K-Mart and current At Home Store) parking lot starting at 9 a.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 14. Residents should doublecheck sites before heading out.¬†  
  
Today‚Äôs sites include: AC Reynolds High School, Asheville Middle School, Buncombe County Sports Park Complex, Black Mountain Ingles, Fairview Elementary School, Swannanoa Ingles, Leicester Elementary School, Linwood Crump Shiloh Community Center, Lucy Herring Elementary School, North Windy Ridge Intermediate School, Pack Square Park, Oakley Elementary, William W. Estes Elementary School¬†  
  
Schools¬†  
Buncombe County Schools will resume extracurricular high school activities today on a voluntary basis.¬†  
  
Community Care Stations¬†  
Community care stations are open at Swannanoa Ingles, A.C. Reynolds High School, and 594 Barnardsville Highway (Morgan Hill Baptist Church). Services include food, WiFi, showers, laundry, and more. Residents should bring toiletries and detergent if they are able to. If not, the stations will supply them.¬†  
  
Solid Waste and Debris Pickup¬†  
Trash and Recycling: WastePro is resuming normal operations for both household trash and recycling. Residents should place both recycling and trash bins out.¬†  
  
Tuesday, Oct. 15: WastePro will run normal routes for‚ÄØaccessible locations in Enka and Candler.‚ÄØWastePro will also have trucks located at ABTech Enka at 1459 Sand Hill Road in Candler from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on Tuesday for residents they are not able to access.‚ÄØ Do not leave trash at this site if trucks are not there. Household bagged trash only.¬†  
  
The Landfill at 85 Panther Branch Road in Alexander is open from Monday through Friday from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Transfer station at Hominy Creek is open from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday for household bagged trash.‚ÄØ‚ÄØ¬†  
  
Debris Removal: Residential debris pickup will begin this week. Residents should separate debris by type and ensure it is placed in the right-of-way.¬†  
  
Important Debris Reminders:¬†  
  
Debris removal is not a one-pass operation. There will be multiple trucks and passes, so residents do not have to place all debris out at one time or worry if they have debris left.¬†  
  
Do not place debris near or on trees, poles, or other structures. This includes fire hydrants, meters, and curbside trash carts.¬†  
  
Do not block the roadway for large trucks/emergency vehicles.¬†  
  
Contractors cannot pick up debris on private property.¬†  
  
Do not attempt the cleanup process without proper PPE: masks, long pants, safety glasses, gloves and sturdy shoes are recommended.¬†  
  
Residents should not attempt to bring debris to the landfill. Mud/soil will not be accepted at any Buncombe County disposal facility.¬†  
  
FEMA Assistance¬†  
This week FEMA will be at fixed locations in the community. Starting today and through Wednesday FEMA sites include:¬†  
  
From 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.: Black Mountain Ingles and Swannanoa Community Care Center Ingles Parking Lot.¬†  
  
From 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.: 572 Fletcher Martin Road in Asheville, Swannanoa Library, Food Lion in Fairview, EMMA Community Center, 1675 Barnardsville Highway, New Bridge Baptist Church, Nesbitt Chapel Church, and 44 Broad River Road in Black Mountain.¬†  
  
From 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.: Pack Square Park and AC Reynolds High School¬†  
  
From 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.: Montford North Star Academy.¬†  
  
The Disaster Recovery Center at AC Reynolds High School is open daily from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.¬†  
  
Donations¬†  
The donation center at 6 Commerce Way in Arden is currently full. Donations can be directed to ABCCM, Bounty & Soul, or Beloved. Clothing donations can be made at Goodwill locations which are providing vouchers for those in need. Financial donations can be made to the United Way of Asheville and Buncombe County at¬†[https://www.unitedwayabc.org/](https://www.unitedwayabc.org/).¬†  
  
Water System Updates¬†  
Water at the Town of Black Mountain continues to be for flushing only. Even if boiled, this water is not for human or pet consumption. The Town of Black Mountain asks residents to not burn within town limits due to dry conditions.¬†  
  
North Fork Reservoir: North Fork continues to feed highly chlorinated water into the City of Asheville water distribution system. In-reservoir treatment at the North Fork Reservoir begins this week so that water can be treated in the treatment plant. Good news is that streams are now feeding clean, clear water to the reservoir.¬†  
  
Distribution System: On Sunday, Oct. 13, the water resources department began supplying water to areas west of Swannanoa. The damage to the Swannanoa area was more severe than expected, but water maintenance crews were able to get water to the Haw Creek junction, which is a primary distribution point for the remainder of the system. While preparations have been completed to begin sending water to the Fairview area and to the higher elevation areas of South Asheville that do not have water, it is important to note that service restoration will continue to return slowly and incrementally, moving west.¬†  
  
Action Steps for Residents:¬†  
  
Report water main breaks to the Water Customer Service Line at 828-251- 1122.¬†  
  
Once water service returns to residences or businesses, customers should flush their private lines by running water through a bathtub or outdoor faucet for about 15 minutes.¬†  
  
Close the valves to hot water heaters or other appliances that run water such as icemakers until the water returns.¬†  
  
Boil water notices and advisories both require customers to boil their water vigorously for at least one minute before drinking, cooking, or brushing teeth.¬†  
  
The water is safe for laundry, handwashing, washing dishes, and showering in but take caution to not get it in the mouth.¬†  
  
City of Asheville Updates¬†  
Public Transportaion: ART service hours have been expanded to 7 a.m.-7 p.m. and is operating for free as flag stops where passengers can board at their preferred location. Three additional routes, N1, S4, and a portion of 170 will run between Haw Creek and the Transit Center. ART is providing service to the majority of the POD sites and FEMA Assistance sites within the City of Asheville. For more information, call the transit customer service, at 828-253-5691.¬†  
  
Storm Debris Removal and Management: There are over 3 million cubic yards of storm debris within Asheville City limits. A private contractor will work on storm-related debris pickup. Temporary debris sites are being established where debris is staged, separated, and processed. City staff have conducted door-to-door outreach to notify impacted residents about the temporary debris sites. This process will continue as new sites are brought online.¬†  
  
Curfew at the City of Asheville is 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. Areas where streets are damaged will now be barricaded with large concrete blocks where police will not be on site to guard.¬†  
  
United Way of Asheville and Buncombe County¬†  
The nonprofit has helped in many ways throughout Hurricane Helene Recovery with a focus on three priorities which include raising and distributing donations to partners engaged in recovery efforts, mobilizing community volunteers to support schools and community partners relief in long-term recovery efforts through¬†[handsonasheville.org](http://handsonasheville.org/), and ensuring they have the most up-to-date information for the 211 call center which many people have relied on for important information during the hurricane.¬†

Sediment can damage your hot water heater, ice maker, or other appliances. Therefore, if you have NO water, turn off the water to those appliances. Then, when you get water back, run water from your hose or bathtub faucet for 15 minutes, to let the sediment clear out of the line. \n\nSince you have had running water for a while,  I *think* you can turn your hot water back on, but don\'t rely on my recommendation- there are lots of posts here about flushing your water heater out so you don\'t damage it. I don\'t have a good one on hand but you can search the subreddit. I am not an expert and I don\'t know how much sediment a hot water heater can handle.\n\nThe boil water advisory is for germs. It won\'t remove sediment but it will sterilize water so you can ingest it. They are heavily chlorinating the water to make it as sterile as possible, but this is not the clean treated water we had before the storm. If it is water you are getting in your mouth (drinking, cooking, brushing teeth) then you *must* boil it (or use potable water from a distribution center). If you are not getting the water in your mouth (shower if you can avoid getting water in your mouth and eyes, laundry, flushing the toilet) you do not have to boil it. \n\nIf you have little kids, don\'t let them bathe in the nonpotable water- they are too likely to swallow the water. Also, if you have an open wound, do not bathe in the nonpotable water- you could get an infection.\n\nYour ice maker (if you have one) should be turned off until the tap water is completely clean and safe to drink.\n\nEdit: this should help  https://www.reddit.com/r/asheville/comments/1g3vkx2/city_of_asheville_alert_1014_6pm_asheville_issues/'}, {'Comment Author': 'SweetOsmanthus', 'Comment Body': 'Boots forever sure a good job of explaining this here so I am just seconding what they said'}, {'Comment Author': 'SweetOsmanthus', 'Comment Body': 'Thanks!'}, {'Comment Author': 'idecipher1', 'Comment Body': 'I know she‚Äôs been trying, even going to the meeting place in town and trying to talk with someone.

After seeing the Elizabeth Barker video on Swannanoa in the news I did some writing to help get out my thoughts out,"I live in Swannanoa. Writing about my experience here during Hurricane Helene. Sorry for the long story. I hope sharing helps people better understand the situation in this area. Apologies for grammar or spelling. 

After the worst of the storm passed on Friday morning myself, my girlfriend, and our next door neighbors walked out of our houses to better understand what the damage was. We live on a steep mountain hill and a tree had fallen blocking our only road down. I could hear a rushing sound and thought it must be the heavy wind in the trees. Looking through the trees below our hill I could see glimpses of water in the fields below.

Power was out and cell service was down. No one knew what had happened. No alerts had come through. We walked cautiously through the woods going down the hill in our pajamas, boots, and rain jackets. We walked through fallen pines, splintered trees, and heavy rain until we reached a clearing of trees. We saw water completely surrounding our hill. 

My girlfriend saw the water before I did. I remember her looking back at me and saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all water.‚Äù I recalled all the people and animals that lived below our hill and realized that they all most likely had perished. A truly terrible moment I‚Äôll never forget. 

We eventually walked to the lower street where the water had flooded to. At the bottom of our street we see a highland cow. It was calling out. A neighbor with bag of carrots for the cow tells us he knows the owner of the farm the cow belongs to. He says ‚ÄúThe cow has two calfs. She‚Äôs probably calling for them‚Ä¶‚Äù He pauses and says ‚Äúand that‚Äôs what she‚Äôs calling for.‚Äù After he tells us, his face frowns, and we realized what he meant. He walked across the street to feed the cow the carrots. 

We walked down the muddy street to the park near the river. A dull pain filled my body as I realized the park that I walked in nearly everyday was completely destroyed. The park was now a rushing torment of flood water. I saw Elizabeth standing with her dog staring out at where the walking trail once was. 

Less than 24 hours ago it was a community park where she walked her dog. Elizabeth was a stranger to me, but a face I had seen before. She was staring out at the rapids. I could understand that she had lost everything, and I understood that this was a disaster. 

Elizabeth turned to leave, gave a friendly solemn look. We said nothing. We shared a non verbal concerning look with half smiles as she walked by. There was nothing we could say. Our lives in this community and in this park were finished.

I bolded what I consider major takeaways:\n\nBen Woody wants to demonstrate the damage we have sustained at our water treatment plants through video and images.\xa0 He said the primary focus will be on the North Fork treatment plant, but also shows some examples of damage to the distribution system and how quickly some of that work is being completed.\n\n**The North Fork Treatment Plant is the principal treatment plant - it‚Äôs the workhorse of our water system.\xa0 We can run the entire system just off North Fork - it is responsible for 80% of our water system.**\n\nStill image of Sept 30, the first day crews were able to get to the site to start clearing debris and get access to the distribution system.\xa0 We have a primary 36‚Äù and 24‚Äù line that comes out of this system - those two lines were washed away in 2004, and were washed away in this storm. Woody says this doesn‚Äôt surprise us- the primary 36‚Äù and 24‚Äù lines are ‚Äúgone. I don‚Äôt know that we‚Äôve even found those yet.‚Äù \n\nThe image shows a bypass water line that was installed as redundancy for another storm event.\xa0 This 36‚Äù bypass water line was engineered based on what happened in 2004.\xa0 **They are focused on repairing this bypass line as repairing it can restore water to 80% of the system.\xa0 This is the priority repair.**\n\nImage shows what used to be a creek bed that normally doesn‚Äôt have substantial amount of water, people can generally walk across it.\xa0 This event washed away almost 25 feet of earth, the pipe is visible but was buried 25 feet deep.\xa0 This is ‚Äúcatastrophic damage‚Äù to the bypass water line. \xa0\n\nWithin 3 days, we‚Äôve been able to make substantial progress on restoring that bypass line.\xa0 We‚Äôre going to put an elbow in and that‚Äôs going to bury that line even deeper than it was.\xa0 We‚Äôre going to armor that line, provide additional bracing.\xa0 Once to work is done to the bypass line, we‚Äôll put the 25 feet of earth back and have a functional line.\xa0 We don‚Äôt need the backfill to be done in order for the line to be functional.\n\n(Technical difficulties in continuing to show images/video so moves on to discuss Mills River temporarily): **Mills River Treatment Plant services South Asheville and South Buncombe County and portions of North Hendersonville county.\xa0 That plant‚Äôs raw water intakes and pumps are fully functional.\xa0 It had reduced capacity a few days ago at 3 million gallons/day.\xa0 We are now producing 5 million gallons/day.\xa0 We have pressure of 160 psi.\xa0 It is operating at pressure and capacity that it needs to be.\xa0 The best that Mills River can do is provide water to about 20% of our water system.\xa0 The lab staff is now actively samping the water.\xa0 You have to sample the water, get bacteria testing, and that is process to return the system to potable water.\xa0 He can‚Äôt give timeline because that depends on the results of the sampling, and it‚Äôs a rigorous test because it can be deemed potable.**\n\n(Photos/videos are back, pivots to North Fork): Shows image that shows progress on Oct 3rd.\xa0 They have started returning it to what it was, even started some of the backfilling. \xa0\n**‚ÄúIf we can get that 36‚Äù bypass water line constructed, we‚Äôll be able to get water from North Fork Treatment Plant into the distribution system.\xa0 We have a lot of work to do on the distribution system and we have to be able to treat the water from the North Fork reservoir.‚Äù**\n\nVideo shows repair work on 8‚Äù line to restore water to Black Mountain.\xa0 Shows erosion of pipes above ground that used to be buried.\xa0 Video shows crew from city of Greensboro working to repair re-bury the line.\xa0 This line is substantially rebuilt and backfilling it and making great progress.\xa0 Black Mountain is also making repairs on their end towards North Fork.\xa0 Employees are waste deep in mud - work is ‚Äúhard, grueling, dirty work‚Äù\n\nMoving on to distribution system.\xa0 We have to get it out of North Fork into distribution system.\xa0 Drone video along old US 70 and Winston Bridge where it crosses Swannanona River on Sept 30.\xa0 The water lines are gone, the roads and roadbeds are gone.\xa0 These water lines are ‚Äúmajor east-west connectors for our water system.\xa0 We have to get these water lines established to get water to Asheville.‚Äù\xa0 Most of the road was destroyed, and what‚Äôs remaining needs to be removed/demolished.\xa0 That needs to be done first.\xa0 NCDOT and city contractors are assisting.\xa0 Video shows lots of construction crews and debris. \xa0\n\nDebris is getting stacked and needs to be removed from roadbed.\xa0 ‚ÄúThat needs to happen all the way to Asheville, not just in this location.‚Äù\xa0 Old pipe is destroyed and has to be removed.\xa0 **‚ÄúThe level of destruction of the road - when the water gets to the bridge, it chokes, and when it comes out of that chokepoint it speeds up in velocity and it just rips the road and the earth away.\xa0 All of that needs to be rebuilt before we can even think about putting water lines in.‚Äù**\n\nNew video from Oct 2: Video shows progress in 2 days, new waterline is ready and secured.\xa0 A lot of the debris has been removed and reconstruction of the roadbed. \xa0\n\n**The city of Asheville has 1,800 miles of waterline pipe - not all of that is damaged, but some of it is.\xa0 If we were to lay that pipe end-to-end, it would to go Miami and back again.\xa0 So when we re-pressurize this system, we have to pressurize 1,800 miles of pipe and refill 42 water tanks.**\n\nStill image before/after - shows debris and torn road.\xa0 Next image shows some debris removed and roadbed back in place.\xa0 Shows another image where dirt is more level with original roadbed.\xa0 The soil has pipe under it that has been backfilled.\xa0 Shows a video of that progress.\xa0 ‚ÄúTremendous amount of progress in 3 days.\xa0 I think you would describe it as absolutely remarkable.‚Äù\xa0 This is just a small example of the sale of damage that occurred of our major transmission lines.\xa0 That‚Äôs just one section and we are working on all sections. \xa0\n\nNew still image of map of water system, shows southern portion in blue served by Mills River.\xa0 Says the map is not exact and doesn‚Äôt have granular knowledge of exactly where water is distributed.\xa0 ‚ÄúWe feel very confident about getting water into Mills River part of the system, pressurizing it, testing it and trying to find a time when it‚Äôs safe to be potable again.\xa0 I could not give you a timeline on when it will be potable again, but we are making progress.‚Äù \xa0""}, {'Comment Author': 'dancormier', 'Comment Body': ""[Here's a document](https://dancormier.notion.site/Bumcombe-County-Government-Impact-of-Hurricane-Helene-on-Asheville-Water-System-1168afed9b20803c8e38fe592d6091fa?pvs=4) I made with screenshots and key points made for anyone looking for a tl;dr on the presentation.

"Disaster SNAP Benefits Application Starts Tomorrow, Application Window is VERY SHORT! ","Here's some important information regarding Disaster SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits, which were just authorized by the state. The link has all the information you'll need, but here are some of the highlights:

 \*Disaster SNAP is not for current SNAP recipients, it is for people who do not get supplemental assistance but who were damaged, lost food or lost income during the hurricane. There is no specific information about an income threshold, but they do ask for information about income and assets during the registration process. 

\*The window to claim D-SNAP benefits is VERY SHORT. If you haven't done it by end of day on October 24, you're out of luck. Buncombe County's Office of Health and Human Services has put out an urgent call for volunteers to maximize their ability to help folks in person. You can also preregister using the website [epass.nc.gov](http://epass.nc.gov), which should shorten the phone or in-person interview you will still need to have. 

You can apply/interview in person at your county's HHS office or by phone at1-844-453-1117. You must call on the correct day based on your last name, as follows: 

10/18: A-G   
10/19: H-M   
10/20: N-S   
10/21: T-Z   
10/22: Open to all   
10/23: Open to all   
10/24: Open to all 

\*You will need to be able to furnish proof of identity and residency. I did the online preregistration and was asked to upload a photo of my driver's license. Other forms of ID/Proof are allowed, there's a list on the website.

Asheville Alert 10/15 4:10pm: Another Slightly Different Systemwide Boil Water Notice,"The City of Asheville just sent out another alert that looks very similar to yesterday's, but with some notable differences. The Water Resources Department seems to be referenced in the title of the alert, and given the differences, WRD may have weighed in on this alert. The notable differences:

* Water can be used for washing dishes at 170 degrees
* Water can be used for washing hands for basic personal hygiene but not for commercial food preparation
* Once the boil water notice is lifted, customers are advised to wait 2-3 hours, then flush only the cold water lines for 10-15 minutes.  If discolored water or air is still present, please call customer service at 828-251-1122.

In case people missed yesterday's or want to review the whole alert themselves, I will post the full text of the alert as well as their Spanish version below. Again, please take care of yourselves and each other!

# English full text

The City of Asheville¬† Water Resources Department is issuing a **Boil Water Notice for all City of Asheville water customers** ¬†due to loss of pressure in distribution system pipes and levels of turbidity (particles) in the water. If¬† you receive this message, you are under a Boil Water Notice.¬†

A **Boil¬† Water Notice** means there is contamination due to impacts from Hurricane Helene including the potential for untreated water in the distribution system from pipe breaks and levels of turbidity that exceed Safe Drinking Water Act standards initially used to restore water pressure. Your water may look cloudy and/or have a chlorine odor.¬†

It is **Required** for customers to vigorously boil tap water for 1 minute before consuming it. Once laboratory testing of the system confirms the possibility of risk is not present, customers will receive notification that the boil water notice has been lifted via the same method you received this notice.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

**Where can customers go to get information?**

For further information, please call 828-251-1122, or visit the City of Asheville Website[ www.ashevillenc.gov](http://www.ashevillenc.gov/)/helene.¬†

**Water can be used for flushing toilets, laundry, bathing, washing dishes at 170 degrees, and washing hands for basic personal hygiene but not for commercial food preparation. During bathing please monitor small children to ensure they do not accidentally drink the water.¬† Infants can be given sponge baths.** ¬†

**What to do before water service returns:**

1. Flip off the breaker to your water heater.¬†
2. Turn off water to your water heater.¬†
3. Turn off hot water under your sinks.¬†

3. It‚Äôs safe to flush your toilet after completing steps 1 and 2.

**What should I do once the notice is lifted?** ¬†

Customers are advised to wait 2-3 hours, then flush only the cold water lines for 10-15 minutes.¬† If discolored water or air is still present, please call customer service at 828-251-1122.¬†

El Departamento de Recursos de Agua de la Ciudad de Asheville est√° emitiendo un Aviso de Hervir el Agua para todos los clientes de agua de la Ciudad de Asheville debido a la p√©rdida de presi√≥n en las tuber√≠as del sistema de distribuci√≥n y niveles de turbidez (part√≠culas) en el agua. Si estas recibiendo este mensaje, te encuentras bajo un aviso de hervir agua.¬†  
Un aviso de hervir agua significa que hay contaminaci√≥n debido a los impactos del hurac√°n Helene, incluido el potencial de agua no tratada en el sistema de distribuci√≥n debido a roturas de tuber√≠as y niveles de turbidez que exceden los est√°ndares de la Ley de Agua Potable Segura utilizados inicialmente para restaurar la presi√≥n del agua. Tu agua puede verse turbia y/o tener olor a cloro.¬†  
Se requiere que los clientes hiervan vigorosamente el agua de grifo por 1 minuto antes de consumirla. Una vez que las pruebas de laboratorio del sistema confirmen que no existe posibilidad de riesgo, los clientes recibir√°n una notificaci√≥n de que el aviso de hervir el agua se ha levantado mediante el mismo m√©todo en el que se recibe este aviso.¬†  
¬øD√≥nde pueden obtener informaci√≥n los clientes?  
Para obtener m√°s informaci√≥n, por favor llama al numero 828-251-1122, o visita el sitio web de la ciudad de Asheville.¬†[www.ashevillenc.gov/helene](http://www.ashevillenc.gov/helene). BARRA  
El agua se puede utilizar para usar pocetas, lavar la ropa, ba√±arse, lavar los platos a 170 grados y lavarse las manos para la higiene personal b√°sica, pero no para la preparaci√≥n de alimentos. Durante el ba√±o, vigila a los ni√±os peque√±os para asegurarse de que no beban el agua accidentalmente. A los beb√©s se les pueden dar ba√±os de esponja.¬†  
Qu√© hacer antes de que vuelva el servicio de agua:  
Apaga el disyuntor de tu calentador de agua.¬†  
Cierra el agua de tu calentador de agua.¬†  
Cierra el agua caliente debajo de los fregaderos.¬†  
Retira el aireador (normalmente se desenrosca) de los grifos.¬†  
Apaga la m√°quina de hielo.  
Cierra el agua del filtro de toda la casa, si tienes uno.  
  
Qu√© hacer cuando regrese tu servicio de agua  
Enjuaga las tuber√≠as de tu casa abriendo el grifo de agua fr√≠a de la ba√±era.  
Es posible que tu calentador de agua se vuelva a encender una vez que se haya lavado la plomer√≠a de tu casa.

Are you in far South Asheville or Arden and are definitely 100% on Mills River plant water? Then you probably don't need to turn off the water to your heater or flush the cold water. If you are in South Asheville but the northern part you may be getting water from both Mills River and North Fork. In that case plug your bathtub drain and run the faucet for 5-10 minutes to fill it up at least halfway and see if the water looks clear or if there is sediment resting on the bottom of the tub. If the water is clear and there is no obvious sediment then the mixture of water you're getting is probably fine and you don't need to shut off the water to your heater or flush your cold water. If you are north of South Asheville, then I would proceed even more cautiously and turn the water to my heater off and flush the cold water just to be sure.

**Ryan Cole Assistant Director of Buncombe County Emergency Services**

As of today, 13 current search and rescues teams operating in the area, 8 are federal teams. 4 local, 6 from NC. Local FDs taking care of communities and increasing communication. Please go to the FD if you need resources or information.

E of I-26 has significant damage, W of I-26 has least amount of damage.

Reiteration of no outside forces in the communities (like those from out of town/state) because it‚Äôs hampering recovery process and we need to keep those pathways open.

Targeted searches are priority where we have to go through debris piles, canines, and large equipment, with no accurate statistic to identify how long it will take to go through everything.

These teams are here for the long haul.

Saturated with donations and situations. Please formulate a plan in three weeks from now, when the resources we have are used up and we need the next wave of aid. So please hold off for now, and help us plan for the future.

**John Coffey Chief Black Mountain Fire Department**

w/ Public Works Director Jamey Matthew and Police Chief Steve Parker.

Our EOC began collaborating the night before the storm. We were familiar with 2004‚Äôs impact. First storm dropped 9‚Äù of water, then the hurricane came. Police Chief and Public Works Director and I worked together to consolidate information and make a plan. 450 people to safety, moved from Search + Rescue operations into Recovery Efforts. We are supporting neighboring fire departments and performing welfare checks. Originally on foot, began secondary contacts on Day 4 and delivering resources. Public Works Director has gotten 90% of roads open for accessibility and emergency vehicles. We‚Äôve been trying to be proactive about breakers in the area and cover meters with covers and even duct tape to prevent possible fires when power comes back on.

¬†

**Chief Anthony Penland of Swannanoa Fire Department**

The landscape has changed. Warnings distributed on Wednesday to extreme areas, and played cell messages in English and Spanish on Thursday. Rescued 16 people out of a trailer park that had mostly evacuated? Still actively trying to find people, searching through debris piles in Bee Tree. We are now trying to make sure our people are also getting rest when they can now that some outside units have come in to provide relief. We have gotten some mental health folks in to try and help with this too.

I've heard of abandoned mines or superfund sites on the mountains. On the rivers they've mentioned industrial waste or agricultural runoff. If that is upstream you still would want to avoid using the water. If you know that the creek originates in a spring and runs through a protected area, it has potential for flush water. It is really essential to know what is upstream.""}, {'Comment Author': 'minimal-camera', 'Comment Body': ""Makes sense, thank you.

Volunteer for Kamala Harris in Asheville and WNC,"**As Hurricane Helene recovery efforts continue,** there is another pressing matter before us: a presidential election on Tuesday, November 5th, 2024.

PS. Don't forget to vote early and bring your ID!

**WHAT TO EXPECT**  
A canvass is focused on going to targeted homes and talking to voters at their door. A phonebank is focused on reaching those same voters by phone.

**WHAT TO BRING**  
If you're canvassing, bring a fully charged smartphone, your charger, and wear comfortable clothes. Additionally, download the ""MiniVAN"" app from the app store (blue logo with white dots) and create an account. All canvassing is completed through the app on your phone (eliminating 90% of the need for paper). When you arrive, you'll be given a list number to begin canvassing.

If you're phonebanking, bring a fully charged phone, laptop, and your chargers. All calls are completed through a website and your phone.

**AND FINALLY, WHY**  
A presidential election is a rare event occurring every four years. We've only had 46 presidents in the history of this country. The two months prior to election day, September and October, are the busiest times.

"Buncombe County Helene Recovery Update 10/24 5:00pm: Disaster Recovery Center, Voting, Mountain Mobility, Temporary Housing, Volunteering, Pisgah Legal Services","Good Evening Buncombians! I am sharing the Buncombe County official updates from today for those who are not receiving their emails.¬†By the way, who is excited for the curtain to be installed in the North Fork reservoir tomorrow!?

I have tried to add some quick formatting and headers to make the update easier to read, since they sent it mostly unformatted. Here is the full text:

# Disaster Recovery Center

The Disaster Recovery Center, a one-stop shop where people can get assistance from FEMA and the Small Business Administration, will move from its location at A.C. Reynolds High at the end of the day today due to school reopening. A Mobile Disaster Recovery Center is open today through Sunday at the Bee Tree Fire Station in Swannanoa from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. and at the Buncombe County Sports Park parking lot starting Oct. 28 through Oct. 31 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.¬†

The Community Care Station at A.C. Reynolds, offering showers, laundry, and more will still operate there. Other Community Care Stations can be found at¬†[buncombeready.org](http://buncombeready.org/)¬†along with food and water sites.

Kids are going to start heading back to school tomorrow, but there are still a number of traffic lights that aren‚Äôt working. Please remember that if a traffic light isn‚Äôt working, slow down and treat that as a four-way stop. We want to keep our kids safe as they return.¬†

# Voting

‚ÄúI told you that Buncombe would vote, and you definitely are,‚Äù said Buncombe County Election Services Director Corinne Duncan during her elections update at the 11 a.m. briefing. ‚ÄúDespite driving around pieces of missing roads, stopping at stop lights that still don‚Äôt work, boiling your water to cook your food, and mourning losses you are showing up to cast your ballot. You‚Äôre making very long lines, and we are happy for it.‚Äù¬†

Over 47,000 voters have cast their vote so far. The voting pattern is different this time around, usually the first days of early voting are highest and then there is a trend down. Not this time - voting is holding steady. This weekend, there will be extended hours for early voting, all 10 locations will be open Saturday and Sunday from 9-5.¬†

**Early voting locations are:**¬†

*  Black Mountain Library,¬†[105 N. Dougherty St](https://www.google.com/maps/search/105+N.+Dougherty+St?entry=gmail&source=g).

* Enka-Candler Library,¬†[1404 Sand Hill Road](https://www.google.com/maps/search/1404+Sand+Hill+Road?entry=gmail&source=g)
* Fairview Library, 1 Taylor Road
* Leicester Community Center,¬†[2979 New Leicester Hwy](https://www.google.com/maps/search/2979+New+Leicester+Hwy?entry=gmail&source=g).
* South Buncombe Library, 260 Overlook Road

Early voting is open daily through Saturday, Nov. 2 at 3 p.m.¬†

View the wait map at¬†[buncombecounty.org/vote](http://buncombecounty.org/vote).¬†

Absentee by mail is still available. There are over 15,000 requests and more than 3,000 of those ballots have been returned. Those are being processed at board meetings and everyone is welcome to watch in person or online.¬†

The deadline to submit an absentee request is Oct. 29. The deadline to turn in ballots is Election Day, Nov. 5 at 7:30 p.m.¬†

Due to Helene, not all of the usual Election Day locations are available to use. All 80 precincts have been accessed and it was determined that 17 need to be moved or transferred to another polling location. We have published those changes on our website and are sending change cards in the mail now to all voters that have a new location.¬†

# Free Community Transport To Vote

Buncombe County‚Äôs community transportation service, Mountain Mobility, is providing direct access to three early voting sites via the Trailblazer routes. **Customers using any of the three Trailblazer routes will be able to use the following sites:**¬†

* Black Mountain Trailblazer riders will have access to the Black Mountain Library¬†
* Enka-Candler Trailblazer riders will have access to the Enka-Candler Library¬†
* North Buncombe riders will have access to the Weaverville Community Center¬†

Customers can be picked up anywhere along a Trailblazer route, and, as always, the service is fare free and available to all.

Qualifying Mountain Mobility customers may take trips to other voting sites.¬†

# Meeting Temporary Housing Needs¬†

Getting families out of shelters and hotels and into longer-term solutions is a priority and FEMA‚Äôs Direct Lease & Multifamily Lease and Repair Programs help families find more stable housing while continue their recovery. FEMA is currently seeking interested, qualified owners or property management companies to help meet the temporary housing needs for Hurricane Helene survivors by leasing their properties directly to FEMA. FEMA is hosting a webinar this afternoon from 2-4 p.m. for property managers and residential property owners who are interested in learning more about leasing directly to FEMA. We will add the link to register for this webinar in the chat.¬†

# Debris Pickup

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is now handling storm debris pickup in Buncombe County. The Corps is operating in Buncombe County and in all impacted county in Western North Carolina. They were already managing debris removal for rivers, streams, and mudslides, and now they‚Äôll be managing all other storm debris in the County.¬†

It is important to separate debris from electronics, vegetative materials, and hazardous waste and place it in the right of way. This graphic on debris removal guidelines is important to share.¬†

# Volunteering

United Way has activated several ways for individuals and groups to volunteer.¬†

Hands-On Asheville Buncombe, an online platform that assists with the mobilization of the thousands of volunteers that will be necessary to recover from this disaster in the days, months and years ahead.¬†  
Volunteer Reception Center at¬†[50 S. French Broad Ave](https://www.google.com/maps/search/50+S.+French+Broad+Ave?entry=gmail&source=g). open every day from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. United Way has partnered with Buncombe County and Lutheran Disaster Response and Relief to launch an in-person Volunteer Reception Center (VRC) to serve as a hub for individuals and groups of volunteers who wish to volunteer to simply walk in whenever the center is open and they will be connected to whatever recovery efforts need volunteers that day. To contact the center, email¬†[uwabcvrc@gmail.com](mailto:uwabcvrc@gmail.com)¬†or call 813-485-1354.¬†

Partners, including national disaster recovery organizations, can register their volunteer opportunities on Hands-On, which will automatically register them for the VRC at the same time. Email the Hands On team at¬†[info@handsonasheville.org](mailto:info@handsonasheville.org)¬†or call 828-393-5628.¬†

The United Way warehouse, which operated in partnership with Buncombe County to receive and distribute supply donations, is now closed. In the three weeks since opening the warehouse, we received and distributed 76 pallets and 2,606 boxes of essential supplies to dozens of frontline community partners. Thank you to the 427 volunteers who donated over 3,000 hours.¬†

"Buncombe County Helene Recovery Update 10/16 2:20pm: Property Reappraisal Delayed, Missing Persons Phone Lines, Cold Weather Shelters & Water Restoration Updates","Hey AVLiens! It seems like these posts continue to assist people that aren't getting all of the official updates being sent out by Buncombe County and/or City of Asheville, so I'm sharing the update emailed out around 35 minutes ago. Please take care of yourselves and each other!

I have tried to add some quick formatting to make it easier to read, since they sent it mostly unformatted. Here is the full text:

# Property Reappraisal Delayed

Last night, the Buncombe County Board of Commissioners approved a resolution to delay the 2025 reappraisal until January 1, 2026. At this time, it is unknown how market values across the county will be impacted by the damage to real estate and personal property. The Property Assessment team is in the data collection and analysis phase and will be spending the remainder of the year working diligently to ensure damaged properties, whether real estate or personal, are assessed as accurate and equitably as possible.¬†

# Water Restoration Updates

As of this morning, the water resources department has substantially restored water to the distribution system into the western and northern parts of the County. At the Eastmoor River Crossing, a single 6-inch line will need to be temporarily replaced for the roughly 75 homes this pipe services while repairs are being done. River redirection is needed to be able to add the line.¬†  
  
All City of Asheville water customers are under a Boil Water Notice, which requires the water to be boiled vigorously for one minute before consuming.¬†  
  
Town of Black Mountain should still only use their water for flushing toilets. Even if boiled, it should not be consumed by pets or people¬†  
  
What to do before water service returns: Flip off the breaker to your water heater. Turn off water to your water heater. Turn off hot water under your sinks. Remove aerator (it typically unscrews) on faucets. Turn off the ice maker. Turn off water to your whole house filter, if you have one.¬†  
  
What to do when your water service returns: Flush your home plumbing by running the bathtub‚Äôs cold-water faucet. Your water heater may be turned back on once your home‚Äôs plumbing has been flushed. It‚Äôs safe to flush your toilet after completing steps 1 and 2.¬†  
  
Report Asheville water main breaks to the Water Customer Service Line at 828-251-1122.¬†

Their crews are out and working on repairs and still expect to make all repairs to locations that have power and are accessible by Saturday, Oct. 19.¬†

# Open Burning Guidelines¬†

Many residents and businesses are turning to open burning as a means of disposal, but as our region dries out, our fire chiefs and our Asheville-Buncombe Air Quality Agency urge community members not to burn. Storm debris collection is beginning, so please use the collection services that are offered. Today, debris collection trucks will be in Swannanoa, Barnardsville, and outside of Woodfin.¬†  
  
For storm debris that is being gathered with the intention of conducting open burning including the use of air curtain burners, permission is required by the Asheville-Buncombe Air Quality Agency and there are certain requirements that must be met. Please contact the Agency at 828-250-6777,¬†[airquality@buncombecounty.org](mailto:airquality@buncombecounty.org), or¬†[abairquality.org](http://abairquality.org/). Never burn synthetic materials or trash.¬†  
  
If you determine that you absolutely must burn, our fire marshal shared this guidance:¬†

* Keep debris burning to small, three-foot piles.¬†  
* Do not ever leave a fire unattended.¬†  
* Have a method of extinguish a fire: water, dirt/sand, motorized equipment, or fire extinguisher.¬†  
* Keep all burn areas clear of any combustible debris or vegetation.¬†  
* Stay 25 feet or more from structures and all wooded areas. We have increased this recommendation from 15 feet based our current conditions.¬†  
* Reminder that burning debris is never allowed in municipalities.

# Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program¬†

People impacted by Hurricane Helene can apply to receive a one-time benefit to help buy food through the Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or D-SNAP. To apply, visit¬†[epass.nc.gov](http://epass.nc.gov/)¬†or call 1-844-453-1117.¬†

# Buncombe County N.C. Cooperative Extension¬†

The Buncombe County N.C. Cooperative Extension received a huge outpouring of people from all over the country wanting to lend their support to the region through donations, volunteering, and youth leader support. Early on in the storm, extension staff worked on meeting the immediate needs of the community through assistance at the water and food distribution sites. Staff have reached out to farmers and partners to check on their status and immediate needs and they have been providing hay, livestock feed, fencing materials, human needs, and more. The NC Farm Help Line is available 24/7 at 844-325-3276.¬†  
  
Farm businesses with damages directly related to the storm can apply for the WNC Communities‚Äô Immediate Disaster Needs grant program.

Hugs from Cyclone Gabriel in New Zealand,"I just want to send y'all hugs from far away. We live on a small island off the NZ mainland and a few years ago had Cyclone Gabriel which devastated a large plain in the main central North Island farming region and here on the island we had landslides including one taking down the entire forested land next to us, including huge trees. (In the Southern Hemisphere, they are called cyclones)

Because Asheville is so similar to this island - rural, forested, hip, left-leaning, I've been lurking - Hurricane Helene damage to you has been reigniting my PTSD. I still won't sleep on the uphill-potential-mudslide-side of our house during big rainstorms now, though it looks safe as it's all thick rain forest up to the road. 

But as bad as Cyclone Gabriel was in our country, we never had our freedumb convoys telling lies on top of all the loss and pain, trying to make victims fear accessing government aid (Billionaires like Peter Thiel buy citizenship here for their boltholes and keep ours busy with other lies to make ours fear ie government run water for the same purpose) 

I just can't imagine how it adds to what you are going through. Anyway. Hugs. I'm so sorry this is happening. And I hope that as with me, the PTSD will subside with time, other than stormy nights.",https://www.reddit.com/r/asheville/comments/1fxtoeb/hugs_from_cyclone_gabriel_in_new_zealand/,1728256493.0,Baselines_shift,asheville,"[{'Comment Author': 'AutoModerator', 'Comment Body': 'Hey u/Baselines_shift, it looks like you asking or commenting about the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.

"Buncombe County Helene Recovery Updates 10/25 1:20pm & 4:50pm: D-SNAP Extension, Water Restoration Updates, Early Voting This Weekend & Buncombe County Sports Park (Dog Park)","Good Evening Land of Sky Folk! I am sharing the Buncombe County official updates from today for those who are not receiving their emails/texts.¬†There was a second update sent out via text today, so I am appending the second one to the bottom of the first here. It's good news for people looking for a dog park in town.

I have tried to add some quick formatting and headers to make the updates easier to read, since they sent them mostly unformatted. Here are the full texts:

# Caution: Tunnel Road & Charlotte Highway Half-Gallons

Out of an abundance of caution, the unlabeled half-gallon bottles of water from the Tunnel Road and Charlotte Highway distribution sites featuring green lids should be used as non-potable or gray water only.¬†

While the water has not been found to be unsafe, there have been reports of discoloration, so water from those bottles should not be consumed. Buncombe County will work with the manufacturer and the appropriate monitoring authorities to ensure the water meets the highest levels of safety. In the meantime, this water should not be consumed.¬†

# D-SNAP Extension¬†

The USDA has extended the deadline for Buncombe County residents to apply for help buying food through the Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) to 4 p.m. Friday. Individuals and households not currently receiving Food and Nutrition Services benefits who were impacted by Hurricane Helene can apply for D-SNAP. Apply in person at Buncombe County Health and Human Services, 40 Coxe Ave., Asheville from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Friday. As of this morning, there was not a long line, so please come down and apply.¬†

The online application process and call center are no longer available.¬†

At close of business Wednesday, Buncombe County had issued 4,276 cards with a total benefit amount of $2,553,456. Additionally, Buncombe County issued 370 cards for customers approved through the state‚Äôs call center process. We also have about 6,000 people who we will be following up with who started that registration process through epass.¬†

This extension is only for residents in Alexander, Buncombe, Haywood, Macon and McDowell Counties only.¬†

# Spectrum Updates¬†

Spectrum has restored service to nearly 93% of customers in Buncombe County with just over 7,000 customers remaining offline as of Oct. 23.¬†

Restoration is taking longer than they initially anticipated due to the amount of damage and repairs required, challenges to safely access certain areas, and the need to return to make repairs in areas where infrastructure is being rebuilt. They are facing specifically challenging rebuild conditions in a number of areas including the Biltmore Forest where in addition to miles of network repairs, they need to rebuild one of the nodes that delivers services to the area. In the Black Mountain area along the Swannanoa River, they are working to repair a major fiber artery for the network. Similar work is being done on our network on the east side of Weaverville. Our crews continue to work through challenges in these and other areas and are looking to restore services as quickly as possible.¬†

Once service has been restored, customers will automatically receive a credit for the time they were without service.¬†

As of this morning 34 Duke Energy customers remain without power. Crews also have been tasked with cleanup, identifying and removing all remaining Duke Energy debris including broken poles, power lines, and transformers that weren‚Äôt removed during the initial restoration process.¬†

# Water and Food Distribution Sites¬†

**Water and meals are available at distribution sites open today and through the weekend at:**

# Water Restoration Update¬†

Turbidity at North Fork Reservoir: Treatment at the North Fork Reservoir to manage high sediment levels is ongoing. As of lyesterday, the level was 25. Under normal conditions the turbidity levels is under 1.¬†

North Fork Auxiliary Spillway: The auxiliary spillway is dry under normal conditions. The reservoir at North Fork was 8 feet below normal before Hurricane Helene, but reached full status on the night of Thursday, Sept. 26, rising 8 feet in 12-14 hours. The level indicators top out at 10 feet above full pool, and the lake reached that point the morning of Sept. 27, meaning it rose an additional 10 feet in 12 hours. It stayed at this level just before noon on Sept. 27. Staff were not able to get an exact reading because the indicator had topped out and it was too dangerous to access. The lake rose at least 18 feet during the storm. The auxiliary spillway activates at approximately 7 ¬Ω feet above full pool, with buckets filling up and mechanically tipping as they are designed to do. The excess rain that landed in the watershed and reservoir naturally flowed out of the emergency spillway by mechanical activation. It is possible that water from one or both of the spillways at North Fork washed out the main transmission lines.¬†

The dams have been inspected by engineers for the third time yesterday, and while there are repairs needed, they are safe.¬†

# Buncombe County Solid Waste¬†

Today, household bagged trash drop-offs can be made at the North Buncombe Pool until 3:30 p.m.¬†

Debris collection is continuing in Fairview, Swannanoa, and North Buncombe. Set out storm debris at the right of way separated it into large appliances, vegetative debris, hazardous waste, construction debris, and electronics. Trucks will make several passes.¬†

Don‚Äôt forget that if you are a Waste Pro customer, you will need to sign up for service with FCC Environmental to continue household trash and recycling pick-up after Jan. 1. Go to¬†[www.buncombecounty.org/solidwaste](http://www.buncombecounty.org/solidwaste)¬†for more information. We know this is really tough to add one more thing as we‚Äôre going through our disaster recovery response, but please go ahead and get signed up so they can be sure to serve you in the new year.¬†

# City of Asheville¬†

ART Transit Services: Starting this Sunday, October 27, ART will resume regular scheduled hours for most bus routes. The schedule is 5:30 a.m. to 11 p.m., Monday through Saturday, and 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sundays and holidays. Buses are no longer offering flag stops. Transit riders need to wait at a designated bus stop to board their bus.¬†

ART service will continue to be free of charge to all community members until further notice. Also, Shuttle service is still providing transportation between the WNC Agriculture Center and American Red Cross shelters.¬†

Please visit¬†[ashevillenc.gov/transit](http://ashevillenc.gov/transit)¬†for more information.¬†

Afterschool programs resume from 3-6 p.m. starting Monday, October 28. Currently the City is only able to offer after school program opportunities to students who were previously enrolled. For more information about these events and additional programming, please visit¬†[ashevillenc.gov/parks](http://ashevillenc.gov/parks).¬†

Storm Debris: A contractor with experience in natural disaster debris removal and work has begun to get this debris out of neighborhoods and business districts. Temporary storm debris sites are necessary to process and ultimately remove debris from our community. The City continues to pursue temporary debris sites in all geographic areas.¬†

While sanitation crews will begin collecting paper bagged leaves starting on Monday, October 28, the City asks to consider waiting as long as you can to set out bags of leaves for collection to help crews move as efficiently as they can through the ongoing storm debris removal process.¬†

The next community briefing will be on Monday at 11 a.m. and can be viewed at [www.facebook.com/buncombegov](http://www.facebook.com/buncombegov)

# Second update starts here

*Edit: Buncombe County sent out a second update around 5:40pm that was very brief. It was titled ""Buncombe County to Resume Regular Operations Where Possible Wednesday."" I am adding it to the end of the larger update here.*

I have tried to add some quick formatting and headers to make the update easier to read, since they sent it mostly unformatted. Here is the full text:

# Duke Energy & Spectrum

As of this afternoon, 129 Duke Energy customers in Buncombe County remain without power.¬†

As of Oct. 21, 85% of Spectrum customers have seen their service restored, and 12,000 remain offline. Spectrum communicated to customers last week that they will automatically be credited for that time without service.¬†

# Water Restoration Updates¬†

Over the weekend, water crews were able to reach 95% water system restoration, including the Eastmoor and Bee Tree areas. There continue to be some areas, including Town Mountain Road and Webb Cove Road, where water restoration is more complicated due to a three-inch line that washed out due to a landslide. Local crews are coordinating with the N.C. Department of Transportation on road repairs. The goal is to have water restored to these areas by the end of the week.¬†

As re-pressurization continues, different breaks are being discovered so some areas that began receiving water may temporarily be out of water as those breaks are being repaired.¬†

The Town of Black Mountain remains under a boil water notice, meaning after vigorously boiling for one minute, this water can be used for drinking, cooking, and more.¬†

In Weaverville, there is no longer a boil water advisory, so that water can be consumed without boiling.¬†  
Donations¬†

The generosity we have seen from the community who have provided much-needed items during a time of crisis is very uplifting. Currently, we are working on distributing the items we have received so we are no longer receiving goods. If you are able to, the best way to support is through monetary donations to organizations such as United Way of Asheville and Buncombe County and the Community Foundation of Western North Carolina‚Äôs Emergency and Disaster Response fund as well as the other community partners who have joined us on these briefings.¬†

The Fire Department of New York (FDNY) has been on the ground in Buncombe County for 19 days providing coordination and allocation of resources. We are entering a new phase of recovery where local services take the lead.¬†

Local emergency response resources have been replenished and assistance has been coming in from state resources, which has helped stabilize most critical needs post-storm. As time has passed, emergency calls have decreased. Immediate threats such as rescue missions, medical emergencies, and hazardous conditions has been addressed. The region‚Äôs infrastructure has seen notable improvements with many roadways cleared, power coming back on, and critical services coming back online. Due to all these improvements, FDNY is beginning its de-mobilization plan. Some areas will continue to receive critical mutual aid including Reynolds, Riceville, Fairview, Swannanoa, and Black Mountain.¬†

FDNY teams will continue to monitor the situation closely, they will be ready to respond if a new situation arises.¬†

# City of Asheville Storm Debris Removal¬†

City officials recognize the importance of quickly and responsibly removing storm debris to ensure safety and support economic recovery. Temporary debris management sites have been set up, with Enka Commerce Park now serving as the primary location for processing and removing debris. The 65 Ford Street site and the Municipal Golf Course will be prepped for possible future use, but Roger Farmer Park will no longer be used. Storm debris brought to temporary sites include construction and demolition, household appliances, vegetation, and household hazardous waste such as paint and batteries.¬†

The debris removal strategy is flexible, aiming to minimize neighborhood and business disruptions, while adhering to safety and environmental regulations. Ongoing communication with affected communities will continue.¬†

‚ÄúThere is and continues to be a sense of urgency about debris removal,‚Äù said Asheville City Manager Debra Campbell. ‚ÄúThe longer storm debris remains in our neighborhoods and business areas the longer we are living with fire and safety hazards. We want our neighborhoods to be safe and we want our businesses to be able to reopen as soon as possible.‚Äù¬†

Debris removal contractor SDR will be monitored by DebrisTech for compliance with environmental regulations. The goal is to get debris to a to-be-determined permanent location as quickly and safely as possible.

The estimated amount of debris in Buncombe County, which includes the City of Asheville, is 10 million cubic yards.

# Buncombe County to Resume Regular Operations Where Possible Wednesday

On Wednesday, Oct. 23, Buncombe County will reopen to the public with regular business hours with the exception of most parks and three libraries.

What mental health tricks are you using to help with the heartache right now?,"We are all dealing with varying degrees of loss and grief right now. For some people, the losses are severe, while for others, we may be feeling survivor‚Äôs guilt or even guilt for grieving over change that may seem inconsequential to others.

What mental health tricks are you using to get you through this difficult time?

For me, one thing I am doing is using music as a tool. Periodically, I have listened to a particular song on repeat: ‚ÄúThree Little Birds‚Äú by Bob Marley and the Wailers (Every Little Thing‚Äôs Gonna be All Right)

Mentally, I am also engaging in self talk reminding myself that, while it‚Äôs true Asheville will never be the same again, it is likely this amazing community will rebuild other new and wonderful elements honoring the rich and eclectic history we have enjoyed in the past.

And of course, it has been amazing to watch people pull together and help each other during these difficult times.

Su agua puede verse turbia y/o tener olor a cloro.¬†  
Es Obligatorio que los clientes hiervan vigorosamente el agua del grifo durante 1 minuto antes de consumirla.

Buncome County Thursday Brief on Helene Relief - Text Transcript,"Hi all, My family has limited access to internet so I've been texting them transcripts of the daily Buncombe County meetings. Hope this is helpful to others.

Buncome County Meeting Transcript (10/3/2024) -  Helene Relief Update from County Officials

""Good morning. My name is Stacey Wood. I'm a public information officer here with Buncombe County Government. Today is Thursday, October 3rd. And we are here to provide an update on the Hurricane Helene response in Buncombe County. Our speakers today include County Manager Avril Pender and Mary Ann with FEMA. Before we get started, a quick note. We need to make a correction to the small donation site drop-off location. It is not Reynolds Middle Warehouse. The site for small donation drop-off is at Beloved Asheville, located at 32 Old Charlotte Highway, Asheville 288. Again, not Reynolds Middle Warehouse. That is not the location for small donation drop-off. The location for small donation drop-off is Beloved Asheville, 32 Old Charlotte Highway. Thank you. With that, we'll get started with remarks from County Manager Pender.

Thank you, Stacey. Good morning. Power is continuing to come online, and 85,000 customers remain without power. I do want to clarify there's been lots of questions about the number of missing or unaccounted for people in Buncombe County. I want to clarify that Buncombe County does not have an official number for unaccounted people. And that's because of three reasons. First, search and rescue continues now for a seventh day. We're continuing to find people. We know we have pockets of people who are isolated due to landslides and bridges out. So they are disconnected but not missing. Power, Wi-Fi, and phone coverage remains a barrier to connections. Only once our search and rescue ends will we truly know a number of unaccounted for.

With our Family Assistance Center, the initiative of our Registered Ease Office, they've deployed 840 volunteers to check. We've deployed 840 volunteers to check. We've deployed 6,065 high-priority households with over 700 care packages being distributed. 2,885 of our neighbors confirmed safe and sound by volunteers. And 1,828 confirmed safe and sound through email and text as of Wednesday, October 2nd. If you want to volunteer, please report anytime between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. to our Registered Office located at 205-COSMO. This is where your help and assistance will be available. We're continuing to find people. Small donations of food, water, toiletries, baby formula, dog food, et cetera, can be dropped off as well. And they would take that out with them when they go out on those checks for neighbors.

Buncombe County has opened two new water and food distribution sites. They're located at King Creek Middle School at 570 Lower Brush Creek Road in Fletcher and Lester Elementary. school at 31 Gilbert Road in Leicester. It will be open noon to 4 p.m. and will have water and ready-to-eat meals. Bring your own water containers. The other locations where you can get water and meals ready to eat are William Estes Elementary School at 275 Overlook Road in Asheville, Sandhill Elementary at 154 Sandhill School Road in Asheville. Please remember to enter from the Acton Circle location, North Windy Ridge Intermediate School at 20 Donner Road in Weaverville, Fairview Elementary School, 1355 Charlotte Highway in Fairview, and Black Mountain Ingalls, 550 NC9 in Black Mountain.

A public AT&T mobile connectivity station has been set up at the Sam's Club at 645 Patton Avenue in Asheville. Folks can access chargers, use computers, and have service for calls. Big Ivy Community Center at 540 Dillingham Road in Barnardsville received several trucks of emergency supplies from Operation Airdrop yesterday, with more arriving today. This includes partial emergency items, food, water, and limited supplies of hay and feed for livestock. If you are in need of emergency supplies, please reach out to us at the Big Ivy Community Center today, October 3rd, starting at noon, cooking hamburgers and hot dogs until they run out of food. Please bring to-go containers if possible and extras to share with those who are stranded. Many in the area are still without power and water.

Volunteers with four-wheelers are willing to hike, and are needed to help distribute supplies. You can also drop off or pick up donations at Barnardsville Elementary School at 20 State Road, 2170 in Barnardsville. Urgent needs include volunteers, porta-potties, especially those that are ADA-accessible, bleach, mold cleaner, personal protective equipment, gas, propane, Coleman stoves, and more along that line. Buncombe County Adult Home Specialists have contacted all assisted care facilities that they monitor to assess their needs, and we have contact with around 60 facilities. All facilities have been reached. Most facilities are without power. However, they have been able to meet their own needs. The pharmacies have been great in delivering medications. The biggest needs are water and gas for generators, and our teams are submitted these requests to the Emergency Operations Center, and fully anticipate being able to meet those needs quickly.

Staff are working to make contact with all of their clients to make sure that they have their needs met. When you are donating items to community donation centers, don't forget to consider supplies that older adults might need like incontinence supplies. Staff are also conducting general outreach to all seniors in our community. We have contacted 301 seniors, identified their needs, and we are working with our registered aides and the United Way to fill these needs. We are also working with them to expand wellness checks for the folks we could not get in touch with. We do not have an update number for loss of lives to provide this morning. The Sheriff will be joining this afternoon at 4 p.m. to provide that update.

Next, we will be joined by FEMA National Incident Management Assistance Team Lead, Mary Ann Tierney. Thank you. Good morning. My name is Mary Ann Tierney. I'm with FEMA. I'm the National Incident Management Assistance Team Lead that is assigned to Buncombe County. The first thing I want to say is that our thoughts are with the people of Western North Carolina. This is a very devastating event. I had an opportunity yesterday to travel around with the County Emergency Management Director to see firsthand the level of damage and devastation it is significant. The recovery is going to take a long time and FEMA will be here for the duration of the response and the recovery. A couple of things that I wanted to highlight. Our number one priority continues to remain remains to be life safety.

As the County Manager mentioned, search and rescue is active and ongoing throughout the county. I also want to encourage people if you're safe and able to do so to please register for FEMA assistance. There are two ways to do that. You can call 1-800-621-7000. You can call 1-800-621-7000. You can call 1-800-621-7000. That's 1-800-621-FEMA. That's 1-800-621-FEMA. Or you can go to disasterassistance.gov. That's all one word, disasterassistance.gov. Registering for FEMA assistance is a critical first step in the recovery process. FEMA has several programs that are available immediately to assist you with emergent needs. One program is called Serious Needs Assistance. This is cash that can help you with life sustaining and life saving supplies like food, water and medical equipment or supplies.

There's also displacement assistance. If you cannot be in your house, there is funding that could be available if you're eligible to stay in a hotel or to stay with friends and family. So I encourage people to apply for assistance. Later on, well actually since yesterday and continuing, we will have disaster survivor assistance teams throughout Buncombe County. We have more people flowing in to support that effort. So you should see FEMA people in your neighborhood helping you register. Those folks will have access to care. So if you're in a community that's in need of assistance, they will be able to help you. They will be able to help you with your communications so that if you cannot register yourself due to your communications outages, they will be able to register you for assistance. So be on the lookout for individuals in FEMA attire and vest that will register you for assistance. And with that, I am complete and I will turn it back over to the county.

Thank you, Marianne. And we will open the briefing up to questions from the media.

This is Keith Campbell from National Watchdog. A moment ago, there was a reference to FEMA assistance teams in the area. How many team members are there in Buncombe County right now? All right. We have about five teams right now, and they're primarily focusing on the points of dispensing. So as people receive supplies, they are registering for assistance. Over the next few days, as we receive more teams, we'll be fanning out throughout the community, including areas that are typically hard to hit. As long as it's safe for our staff to travel, they will go into communities and to neighborhoods and register people. Thanks. But I have a follow-up. Team members, you mentioned there are teams here, but how many members per team?

Can you give us a total for what you have now and what you expect to be coming and when that additional, source will be here? A DSA crew has typically eight people. We can follow up and get you the specifics on where our teams are today, and also how many are actually working today. I think that would be important information, especially because they're at the pods. And so it'd be helpful to get the word out about their location so that people can register for assistance. Thank you. Hi, it's Laura Lee at Blue Ridge Public Radio. Before you step away, I was going to try to catch you. Can you just help us understand the distinction here? We've got FEMA teams on the ground registering people for- For assistance.

But can you talk about the operations that FEMA is doing, particularly in terms of supplying actual water and food on the ground? Yeah, that's a great question. So FEMA does a variety of things in a disaster response. One thing we do is provide commodities through staging areas. So commodities are food and meals ready to eat in this particular instance. That's done in concert with our state and local emergency management partners. So we have a staging area with those supplies. And then as- And then as the state and the county and local officials need them, then we will distribute them to the state and local officials. And then they operate the points of dispensing where the supplies are actually given out. Katie Hillen with News 13. This may be a FEMA question or a county question. Just wondering, does Mission Hospital have water now? If so, how did that come about? And if not, what's the plan? Absolutely. I believe that would be a question for the county.

We will get your more updated answer. But from my understanding, the last time we spoke, Mission did have water being trucked in, similar to what you've seen at the pods, distribution sites. They've been using a private company to bring water to Mission. So does that mean they actually have water coming out of the spigots and toilets flushing, or that means water is just being trucked in? I don't have a more detailed answer. I just know that they have water being trucked in. We will research that and get that answer for you. Okay. Hello. Virginia Bridges from the News and Observer. I was hoping that you could walk us through the process for county officials as they're confirming these deaths, starting from the ground where they're finding them to where it's reported to us.

Could you explain how that works? I will defer that question to when the sheriff is with us this afternoon. Manager Pinder, it's Laura Lee at Blue Ridge Public Radio. A couple of questions for you. One is about sewage. We've talked a lot about the water. And can you talk to us about people who are not having water clearly creates difficulties on the sewer system. Can you talk about that at all? No, I don't have any knowledge on the sewer system. We'll defer that to MSD. And they'll be joining us tomorrow, I'm being told. Okay. What about the potential for public health issues from the lack of water and sanitation services right now? Is there a plan for a potential sort of impending public health situation? Not at this time, Laura Lee.

I believe that I would get that answer from Ellis. I'm looking at my team. They're taking notes. I'm like, oh, I don't have any leadership. I'm like, oh, I don't have as you're asking your questions so we can make sure we bring the information you're looking for. Great, just a couple more. We talked yesterday about non-potable water from the JCC. Are there other sources of non-potable water for people who need it? Not at this time. We've been working diligently to find a provider that would truck watering as well for non-potable. So people are not using the drinking water for flushing toilets. I've not been successful. The team is still looking for non-potable.

So as we reached out and talking on the medias, if anyone out there has a non-potable source of water, please call the EOC and we will look to see if we can find some contracts. But finding non-potable has been harder than we thought. Is the FEMA representative, I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name, Marian. Do you have any sort of non-potable water that we could have here? Yeah, that's a great question. Actually, that's something that we've been discussing with the county and also is being discussed in Raleigh at the State Emergency Operations Center, a way to distribute in bulk non-potable water so people can do things. Things like clean their plates and flush their toilets. Do we have a timeframe on that? Oh yeah, do you have a timeline on that?

I do not. That's something that I would defer back to North Carolina Emergency Management. Okay, and then- I will say real quick, we have been working closely with the state on other supplies. So as soon as we get a timeline, we'll get that to you. And I see- Can I ask about mobile distribution of- Oh, sorry, go ahead. I see Lillian stepping up. Maybe she has an answer on one of your questions from previously. Yeah, Lillian Govis, Director of Communications and Public Engagement. Just wanted to give an update on MSD. That plant has been operational the entire time and they have been treating the entire time. They have 37 out of 40 pump stations that are working either with backup power or with full power.

And so they've got a few transmission lines that have leaks and breakages and they're working on repair. But they're making a lot of progress and our sewage district has been operational throughout this entire disaster. So if people are able to get water from places like creeks and other non-potable water sources, then they should be able to flush toll. It's no problem for the vast majority. Is that what we're saying? Yeah, that's correct. Great. My other question was about mobile distribution of water. We've talked about distribution points and I think, forgive me the time, I don't know which day, if it was yesterday, or the day before, but where are we on mobile distribution of water to people who are unable to access those distribution points? That question is very timely.

So just this morning, we had a meeting with county and city of Asheville officials to talk about direct delivery of supplies. So that is a project that the county is working on and FEMA will be supporting that with personnel resources. And I don't have a specific timeline on when that will start, but it will be in the coming days. Okay. Manager Pender, as you can imagine, it's frustrating for people to hear that there are meetings about this when they're existing without water for several days if they're elderly or vulnerable and cut off. Does the county have any response to the delays that we've seen in mobile water distribution? Yes, as I mentioned in my talking points at the top of this, we have reached out to all of those seniors and nursing homes and we're taking water to those places where masses of people are gathered.

So we are taking water there. We have worked with a couple of nonprofits to get them up to speed so we can get them to take water out as well. To Marianne's point, planning is important. I hear you when you say there's delays, but planning is important. We work really hard to get those points of distribution so that people that have the ability can come so we can serve lots of people. But through those, those distribution points and that has been happening, now we're going down the line and making sure people that can't get here is getting water. But first we went large and now we're whittling down to make sure people can get what they need if they can't get to us. And as Marianne, that's within the next couple of days.

So I hear you with the delays and I understand that and it breaks my heart that we couldn't do everything all at once, but we have been working hard to make sure we can serve our community and serve our community well. And to those points that you're saying you've taken water out where people are sort of in mass, nursing homes, et cetera, does that include any public housing? And do you have any other comments on access to basic necessities for people in public housing? Yes. And if you recall earlier, one of these, I forget how many days we've been doing these now, but one of those, we told you that our community paramedics has been going door to door in our public housing to make sure people had water.

They were taking bottle of water with them as they were going door to door in our public housing complex. So yes, ma'am, that has also been on our list. I have a water related question. Yesterday, at the four o'clock briefing, Deborah Campbell said that the city had enough water to last through Friday. Has that changed? Is there additional water or additional length of time that water will be available? Water will be available. We have contracted as well and they're replenishing as we empty one of those tankers, they're replenishing them for us. I believe our water supply right now is coming out of Spartanburg. South Carolina. So when we finish, I don't remember the number of those large tankers we have on site. I want to say about 10.

So as soon as one is finished, that can go back and make it to Spartanburg and bring back water. So we do have a supply of water and we continue. I've said before, we will continue to provide that water to our community. We also have the water coming from our state now on a regular basis. So we do have bottle water that is coming in. We had some nonprofits to also supply water to our community. So our rural central kitchen is here bringing water as well. So I do believe we have a supply of water and it's no more consistent that we have water. So we will continue to provide water both to the city sites as well as to the county sites.

And then are we still saying that do we have a better timeline for residents who don't have water? Are we still saying weeks? Can you provide any more information about that? That would be a question that we'll direct to the city staff. They're on the four o'clock briefing tomorrow for full details. But we're still saying that we have water. But Ben would be here in the afternoon to answer any specific questions on the water distribution from the city's plan. Yes. Patricia from Enlace Latina NC. There is people in the community that have seen that border patrol cars. I know that it's not about the Hong Kong County thing, but people in the community are worried about that. The information that we have is there. So I'm here for helping, but it will be important to hear about that from you so we can bring the information to the Latino community about that.

OK, thank you. I also saw border patrol officers providing security. Their mission is security related. ICE and border patrol are not conducting enforcement operations. In the area. OK, thank you. We also have another question from Walter Gomez of Enlace. To bring peace of mind to the Latino community, can FEMA, Marianne, please explain their work in the area and if they have bilingual personnel? Yeah, I'll take the bilingual question first. So FEMA will translate all of its all of its materials are available in Spanish, and we are aware of the languages that are spoken throughout the county. So we will be working to ensure that we can meet the language access needs of people within the county.

In terms of the border patrol officers that are here, they are providing security on behalf of FEMA forces like the urban search and rescue teams and also at the request of the state and the county. And so they are again, ICE and border patrol are not conducting enforcement operations in the area. Laura, I'm Laura Lee at BPR again. I want to ask about internet service, cell service. We have these temporary measures you described, Manager Pender about access points. Do we have any sort of information from the companies about how much longer people are going to have to rely on those temporary points of access? Unfortunately not. We don't have any information yet on how long it will take to put those towers back up.

However, we are sure that one of the things Helen Chikering from BPR has asked about portable toilets for the community. Are there any updates on these kinds of availability, and is FEMA helping with that? I don't believe that is on FEMA's list yet at this point in time. We are working on those toilets, as you mentioned. There are a few already deployed. I know the city has them at their sites in the city limits, and we're also looking. That has been a top commodity to get more toilets in, but we are working on putting those at our distribution sites as well across the county. Lucas Tomei with Carolina Public Press saw yesterday that President Biden approved mobilization of active duty military to affected areas.

I'm just wondering if any of those troops have arrived and what their role will be once they reach Buncombe County. Yeah, that's a great question. So as I mentioned earlier, that we would have federal personnel that would be able to do support the delivery of commodities directly to individuals, and that is one of the missions that we are scoping for those soldiers. Is there any update on the or information on the Chemtronics Superfund site? Any information about the concerns related to environmental concerns related to that or health concerns related to that? I haven't heard any concerns. Can you share specifically what you're reading? Is that what you're referring to? Yeah, sure. We just have received questions about, you know, has that been breached? Is anyone testing the waters or the soil around that site? We'll take that question back, but I haven't. This is the first I'm hearing of that. So we'll research and get you an answer.

We had one question in the chat. We had one question about whether any of the county facilities sustained damage. Our teams are starting to do that damage assessment now. I haven't seen anything. We had some trees down, but we haven't heard anything coming back from that damage assessment team that is going out. We took all the staff we had first to make sure we had our community organized and get services out to our community, and now we're going back to reassess county operations.

I will say that we're currently, you know, in a couple of weeks, we'll have an election. So we're also working on making sure we have the facilities and our early voting sites. That is our first priority as we go back to assessing county operations. The first priority would be making sure early voting sites are ready and available. We'll start working again on getting our full workers trained. So operation still has to happen, even though in the middle of a disaster. So we're trying to split our team. And we're so grateful to our state partners. To send crews in from across our state, across our nation now, to help us so that we can get our teams back to doing the regular work that they would normally be doing. This is Andy Rose with CNN. I apologize if I just missed it at the beginning, but is the confirmed fatality toll in Buncombe County still 61? I don't have an updated number this morning, Andy. The sheriff will be here at four o'clock and he will bring us any updated loss of lives in our community.

thank you thank you um thanks to our speakers today um as a reminder that number that marianne provided is 1-800-621-FEMA and that number will take you to the registration for FEMA assistance 1-800-621-FEMA we will be back at 4 p.m today thank you for joining us and with that we will conclude this briefing.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/asheville/comments/1fvizpk/buncome_county_thursday_brief_on_helene_relief/,1727991425.0,No-Catch6733,asheville,"[{'Comment Author': 'None', 'Comment Body': 'I think they are being weird about the number of people missing.

In search of a day care options - WAVL or nearby,"Hi all - I'm hoping to help my neighbor out during these post hurricane Helene times. He's a single father of 2 very sweet girls (5yo / 3yo) and is struggling as he needs to return to work but is unable to without having proper care for his two girls. 

As far as I understand, day cares are currently not open due to water / or have a massively long waitlist to even get in. Unfortunately, my partner and I are unable to assist as he needs full time care for his kids (something like 5 days a week, for a full workday of \~7am-\~3pm). 

I was wondering - does anyone have any resources or options that I can send over to him that others may be doing in these times? We're in West Asheville, so I'm sure that would possibly be ""best"", but at this point - am just hoping to send any resources that he can use to be able to support his family.

Resources for disaster relief ,"I put this together in response to some requests on r/assistance. Don't know if you will want it here, but I'm good at finding resources and explaining them in order of importance. The subs pinned resource guide is a little overwhelming. Idk, hope it helps!


LEGAL AID NORTH CAROLINA has an extensive resource guide to government resources for hurricane helene. On the link I provided, you can access the applications/websites for fema, disasted unemployment, housing resources, and their Disaster Handbook, which you can download but is where I got the following info: 

*****

 FEMA: Overview of FEMA disaster assistance you may qualify for disaster assistance through Housing Assistance and Other Needs Assistance. 

Housing Assistance may include funds for home repair, replacement, or temporary housing.

 The Other Needs Assistance program provides funds for uninsured, disaster-related necessary expenses. These may include: ‚Ä¢ Medical and dental expenses ‚Ä¢ Repair or replacement of household items or vehicles ‚Ä¢ Moving expenses ‚Ä¢ Other essential expenses related to recovery from the disaster

 Homeowners whose losses were not fully compensated may qualify for low-interest disaster loans 

 You can apply for FEMA assistance: ‚Ä¢ 

Online at www.DisasterAssistance.gov  ‚Ä¢ 

By Phone at 1-800-621-3362 or TTY -800-462-7585. Operators are multilingual and calls are answered seven days a week. ‚Ä¢

 You can visit a FEMA Disaster Recovery Center in person

 When you apply for disaster assistance, have the following information with you: ‚Ä¢ Social Security number ‚Ä¢ Address of the damaged home or apartment ‚Ä¢ Description of the damage ‚Ä¢ Information about insurance coverage ‚Ä¢ A current contact telephone number and mailing address ‚Ä¢ Bank account and routing numbers for direct deposit of funds (Note: did you provide all of these things when you applied?)

 After you apply, FEMA will contact you to schedule an appointment with a home inspector. If you qualify for a grant, FEMA will provide you a check by mail or a direct deposit into your checking or savings account, and a letter describing how you are to use the money. If you do not qualify for a grant, FEMA will provide you a letter explaining why you did not qualify, and an opportunity to appeal the decision. (Note: Legal aid north Carolina can help you file an appeal) 

******

Disaster Unemployment Assistance: Weekly benefits for people who have lost wages due to the hurricane bc they are unable to work, have lost their workplace or supplies, can't connect to jobs either physically or online
 
From their website, where you can find more info and FILE A CLAIM ONLINE: https://www.des.nc.gov/

 
People, self-employed people or business owners may be eligible for DUA if:

You lived, worked or were scheduled to work in an area declared a disaster area by the President of the United States;

You lost employment or had your employment interrupted as a direct result of the disaster; and

You have exhausted or are not eligible for state unemployment benefits.

---Proof of Self Employment - Self-Employment 

Federal tax return for prior taxable year
Business license
Recent Bill in the company‚Äôs name
Work logs showing current business
Customer invoices
Recent contracts
Property titles/deeds
Rental agreement for place of business
Bank statements in the company‚Äôs name


Legal Aid North Carolina can also help you apply and appeal for FEMA benefits, insurance claims, and help navigating the benefits available- (866) 219-5262




-----_------------


according to the Red Cross Website, they have multiple open shelters in your area. These shelters aren't just for overnight lodging, it looks like they are coordinating all of their disaster services, including case management, from the shelters. 

Call 1-800-RED-CROSS
https://www.redcross.org/get-help/disaster-relief-and-recovery-services/find-an-open-shelter.html
Download their app

At their shelters, they provide: Meals, snacks and water
Health services (for disaster-related conditions), such as first aid, refilling lost prescriptions or replacing lost eyeglasses
Emotional support and mental health services
Charging stations for cell phones and medical devices
Emergency supplies to help clean up after a disaster
Access to multi-agency disaster-related resources in the community
Access to caseworkers to help you with disaster recovery planning and financial assistance for those who qualify
 

They encourage you to download their emergency app, to find update resources, however I found shelters at:

A-B Technical Community College 340 Victoria Ave Asheville

Golds Gym 1815 Hendersonville Rd.
Asheville, NC 28803
Buncombe County

WNC Agricultural 1301 Fanning Bridge Rd.
Fletcher, NC 28732
Buncombe County

Madison Early College High School
5734 US Hwy 25-70
Marshall, NC 28755


There are quite a few more, but IDK what side of Asheville you are on, so I figured this would be a good place to start with the red cross. I have also personally found that going to the shelter in person, while a pain in the ass, will always result in more help. 

**********""""""""""--_--------------------

FEDERAL/STATE BENEFITS: SNAP (FOOD STAMPS) + SUPPLEMENTAL SNAP + DISASTER SNAP + REPLACE FOOD LOST / MEDICAID / TANF- TEMPORARY CASH ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY FAMILIES 


 You can apply online at https://epass.nc.gov/
Apply over the phone (you have to call I think to apply for disaster or replacement benefits) 1-866-719-0141


Do this right away! 

You can use food stamps on Amazon for anything btw. 


ALSO VERY IMPORTANT, DISASTER FOOD STAMPS (EXPEDITED)

D-SNAP helps people who have disaster-related expenses such as lost income, lost or damaged property, or lost food due to power outages. D-SNAP benefits are issued within three days using an EBT card that can be used to purchase food. The amount of money that is put on the card will depend on the number of people in the household.

 People who were already receiving SNAP before natural disaster: ‚Ä¢ Will automatically receive a ‚Äúsupplemental‚Äù benefit if they were not already receiving the maximum amount of benefits ‚Ä¢ Will be allowed to purchase certain hot food with their EBT cards; and, ‚Ä¢ Can apply for Replacement SNAP Benefits if they lost food because of the hurricane.CRISIS MINISTRY- FOOD (PANTRY AND DAILY MEALS) , CLOTHING, RENT/MORTGAGE, UTILITIES, COORDINATED CARE NETWORK

The reason this place is important is that they have access to doing an intake for you in a coordinated care system.

I don't remember what hotel, it was tall and downtown. But our Pontiac Bonneville got stolen. Then it got dumped at the Confederate mt Rushmore, which is wild btw. The car was in perfect shape, but the thieves stole our beach stuff AND my Billy Ray Cyrus Achy Breaky Heart Cassette AND my Young Guns Soundtrack Cassette. I was very upset. They left my grandpa's Hank Williams and Statler Brothers cassettes. \n\nIn all seriousness, we went to topsail almost every year to meet up with my grandmas hillbilly ass relatives. They came down from the hollers and brought their fiddles and banjos and got drunk and played poker on the island that Blackbeard beached his boat. But we would often stay in Maggie Valley, which idk if it got hit but I imagine it did. And we would stop at this amusement park at the top of a mountain, and it had that swing ride and it put you out over the top of the mountain, it was cool as fuck. \n\n\nPlease copy and paste it, and post it on Facebook or next door or whatever. \n\nI've been on my own since I was 11 and I have had to be the parent for my siblings that I never had. I've had to leave an abuser with just my dog and suitcase and cancer, and rebuild my life from scratch. I've stayed in shelters and transitional housing, and have seen how difficult it is for people to navigate the system. \n\n\n\nI tried to organize this from Most Important Long Term, do ASAP, then to the non-profits doing disaster relief, then the local Immediate Needs like food, clothes, shelter. I learned that using the non-profits training guides are often more helpful bc they compile all the resources and break down the assistance better. That's what I used for the federal/state stuff, the legal aid handbook for disaster relief for Helene. Then I went to findhelp.org, and then I looked up grants being offered and who the money was going to- like the NC Disaster Relief Fund is a grant that has to go to non-profits or local municipalities, but then I can find resources being offered at those individual places that people might not know about. \n\nThen I finally went to the counties site, read the press releases, went on Facebook, etc. \n\n\nIf anyone sees this and needs help in other areas, let me know.

"Today's Buncombe Update 10/18 2:40pm: Fire Safety, U.S. Geological Survey Updates & Water System Restoration","Hello again Asheville! Yesterday's update was delayed by the auto mod, so it will post around the same time as this one. Both updates contain some different information, so you may find it worthwhile to read both. Many people still aren't receiving the official updates being sent out by Buncombe County and/or City of Asheville, so I'll continue to share them here as long as it seems to be helping people. This update was emailed out today around 2:40pm. Keep hanging in there! Y'all are doing great!

I have tried to add some quick formatting to make it easier to read, since they sent it mostly unformatted. Here is the full text:

# Food and Water Distribution¬†

At the end of the day Friday, the food and water distribution sites at North Windy Ridge Intermediate School and Estes Elementary School will close to support school reopening. There will be no other changes to water and food sites or community care stations over the weekend.¬†

**Food and water distribution sites:** 

* AC Reynolds High School
* Buncombe County Sports Park
* Black Mountain Ingles
* Fairview Elementary School
* Swannanoa Ingles
* Leicester Elementary School
* Linwood Crump Shiloh Community Center
* Sky Lane Bowling
* At Home Store (former Kmart)
* Pack Square Park
* Innsbruck Mall (former Big Lots) (*I corrected the spelling of this location*)

The Town of Black Mountain water is now under a boil water notice, meaning after vigorously boiling for one minute, this water can be used for drinking, cooking, and more. In Weaverville, there is no longer a boil water advisory, so that water can be consumed without boiling.¬†

As of this afternoon, 469 Duke Energy customers in Buncombe remain without power.¬†

# Early Voting¬†

Early voting continues through the weekend between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. The ballot is quite long, but you can view it at¬†[buncombecounty.org/vote](http://buncombecounty.org/vote)¬†before you go so you can see everything that‚Äôs included. Voting location sites include:¬†

* Black Mountain Library¬† 
* East Asheville Library¬† 
* Enka-Candler Library¬† 
* Fairview Library¬† 
* Leicester Community Center¬† 
* South Buncombe Library¬† 
* UNCA Health & Counseling Center¬† 
* Weaverville Community Center¬† 
* Dr. Wesley Grant Southside Center¬† 
* West Asheville Library¬† 

# Parks Updates¬†

Buncombe County parks are closed and all Parks and Recreation events, including Fall-O-Ween, are canceled indefinitely as staff have been reassigned to help with disaster recovery and response. As of today, several Asheville Parks & Recreation parks have reopened. The list of reopened parks are at¬†[ashevillenc.gov/parks](http://ashevillenc.gov/parks).¬†

# Fire Safety¬†

Important safety reminders as the community continues to receive power. If your electrical service has not been restored, please turn off all circuit breakers in your panel, especially your water heater.¬†

Once power is restored, please turn them on one at a time with a short pause between breakers. Start with lighting and outlets first before major appliances.¬†

Do not turn on the water heater until you have ensured the tank is full.¬†

Do not re-power your home and leave. Monitor your home for smoking, discolored, or excessively warm outlets.¬†  
Visually monitor your circuit panel for smoke or excessive heat.¬†

# D-SNAP¬†

Through Oct. 24., Buncombe County residents can apply for help buying food through the Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP). Individuals and households not currently receiving food and nutrition services benefits who were impacted by Hurricane Helene can apply for D-SNAP. People can start applying for assistance now through Tuesday, Oct. 22 through the online pre-registration at‚ÄØ[epass.nc.gov](http://epass.nc.gov/)¬†or by calling D-SNAP Virtual Call Center at 1-844-453-1117.‚ÄØ Applications can also be made in-person at 40 Coxe Ave. Monday-Friday between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.¬†

# FEMA¬†

Nearly 37,000 people have been approved for more than $43.5 million in Buncombe County. Register for disaster assistance at¬†[disassterassistance.gov](http://disassterassistance.gov/), by calling FEMA 1-800-621-3362, downloading the FEMA app, or visiting the Disaster Assistance Center at A.C. Reynolds High School.¬†

If home inspections show inaccessibility issues, people can call FEMA at 1-800-621-3362 or visiting the Disaster Recovery Center to schedule an appointment¬†

FEMA is hiring a team in Western North Carolina, apply at¬†[usajobs.com](http://usajobs.com/).¬†

# Social Security Administration¬†

The federal agency has been helping the community with social security staff presence at the Disaster Recovery Center. So far, they have helped serve 1,830 people.¬†

# U.S. Geological Survey¬†

U.S. Geological Survey staff map, model, and respond to landslide events. In terms of the impact to the community, this is one of the worst in U.S. history, said Jonathan Godt, Landslide Hazard Program Coordinator. There were at least 1,000 landslides initiated by the pre-storm and Hurricane Helene. The good news is that no large landslides have been identified that could occur in the coming weeks or months.¬†

During heavy rainfall, landslide scarps, which are steep portions of land with exposed dirt and rock, can be active again during heavy rainfall.¬†

Three things that can determine a landslide are the steepness of the mountain, the amount of precipitation, and the path the water and mountain can go which is typically a stream channel. The chance for a landslide increases if it rains more than 5 inches in 24 hours or a few inches for several days in a row. For more information, visit¬†[landslides.usgs.gov](http://landslides.usgs.gov/).¬†

# Disaster Debris Removal¬†

Disaster debris removal is underway at public roads and right of ways in Buncombe County. SDR is the County‚Äôs removal contractor which specializes in disaster recovery. Estimates show that Hurricane Helene created 5 million cubic yards of debris in the public right of ways in incorporated Buncombe County alone. With this historic amount, it will be a long removal process.¬†

There are 3 temporary debris disaster sites in Buncombe County: Cane Creek Park, the old Enka Landfill in Woodfin, and at the AB Tech Campus in Candler, all permitted through a process with the state. These sites are only to be accessed by SDR, not the public.¬†

A reminder that trucks are making several passes. Citizens should push their debris at the right of way even at sites that were previously full and were picked up, trucks will come by again to pick up.¬†

Put safety first when moving debris, use appropriate protective gear including long pants, long sleeves, safety gloves and glasses. Do not block roads with debris.¬†

The Solid Waste department is engaging with partners in the assessment process for debris pickup on private roads.¬†

# City of Asheville Permits¬†

Permits available at¬†[develop.ashevillenc.gov](http://develop.ashevillenc.gov/). Permits are available for immediate removal of debris related items and reconstruction. All permit fees are waived.¬†

Emergency Permits in response to Helene are available at¬†[develop.Ashevillenc.gov](http://develop.ashevillenc.gov/)¬†for building repairs, including electrical, mechanical, and plumbing work. Fees are waived, and permits are issued within 24 hours. Special rules apply for historic districts and flood zones.¬†

Permits are required for all work, and damage over $40,000 must use a licensed contractor. Phase 2 of building damage assessments began on Oct. 17 and will post buildings with green (safe), yellow (partially safe), or red (unsafe) tags. For more details, visit the website or contact¬†[PAC@ashevillenc.gov](mailto:PAC@ashevillenc.gov)¬†or 828-259-5846.¬†

# Water System Repair Updates¬†

Currently, water backfilling and re-pressurization is happening at water lines, so leaks and breaks continue to be found as this happens.¬†

At Eastmoor, contractors were able to clean up a lot of debris and made one connection today and are working on a second connection today. Work continues on a temporary line at this site and the goal is to start pushing water this evening to residents serviced by this line.¬†

The North Fork Reservoir is undergoing sediment treatment process, crews are waiting a couple of days to see how effective the first round of treatment was, before beginning second treatment.¬†

Service is now back to 90-95% of the system, some places like elevated areas do not have service.¬†

# Goodwill¬†

Goodwill‚Äôs community response includes opening three community hub locations serving as a centralized site for goodwill to provide programs, services, and retail resources. The Asheville location is at 1616 Patton Ave. At this hub, team members will help file for Disaster Unemployment Assistance, help applying or reapplying for FEMA, and submit insurance claims. The Goodwill Good Neighbor Voucher program provides $25 to individuals who have need for goods, clothing, household items. Goodwill is also taking donations of coats and items to keep warm.",https://www.reddit.com/r/asheville/comments/1g6r46w/todays_buncombe_update_1018_240pm_fire_safety_us/,1729281257.0,SweetOsmanthus,asheville,"[{'Comment Author': 'Wallmassage', 'Comment Body': 'Thanks for posting!'}, {'Comment Author': 'AutoModerator', 'Comment Body': ""Hey u/SweetOsmanthus, it looks like you are trying to post an inquiry about visiting the Asheville area.

Plumbing questions for plumbers or ppl with whole home filters,"I keep reading that people with tankless water heaters need an inline pre filter to keep their tankless water heaters alive with all the silt in the lines. 

 While I‚Äôm the only on who will use the tap water to shower twice a week, and we run the dishwasher maybe twice a week as well.. should we look into a whole home pre filter even though we don‚Äôt have a tankless water heater? Is that even a thing? 

  If the silt gums up the dishwasher, would that make it back up and dump water all over the floor? 

Also, is City of Asheville charging for water when it‚Äôs non potable?

Buncombe County Thursday (10/3) Helene Update Transcript,"Good morning. My name is Stacey Wood. I'm a public information officer here with Buncombe County Government. Today is Thursday, October 3rd. And we are here to provide an update on the Hurricane Helene response in Buncombe County. Our speakers today include County Manager Avril Pender and Mary Ann with FEMA. Before we get started, a quick note. We need to make a correction to the small donation site drop-off location. It is not Reynolds Middle Warehouse. The site for small donation drop-off is at Beloved Asheville, located at 32 Old Charlotte Highway, Asheville 288. Again, not Reynolds Middle Warehouse. That is not the location for small donation drop-off. The location for small donation drop-off is Beloved Asheville, 32 Old Charlotte Highway. Thank you. With that, we'll get started with remarks from County Manager Pender.



Thank you, Stacey. Good morning. Power is continuing to come online, and 85,000 customers remain without power. I do want to clarify there's been lots of questions about the number of missing or unaccounted for people in Buncombe County. I want to clarify that Buncombe County does not have an official number for unaccounted people. And that's because of three reasons. First, search and rescue continues now for a seventh day. We're continuing to find people. We know we have pockets of people who are isolated due to landslides and bridges out. So they are disconnected but not missing. Power, Wi-Fi, and phone coverage remains a barrier to connections. Only once our search and rescue ends will we truly know a number of unaccounted for.



With our Family Assistance Center, the initiative of our Registered Ease Office, they've deployed 840 volunteers to check. We've deployed 840 volunteers to check. We've deployed 6,065 high-priority households with over 700 care packages being distributed. 2,885 of our neighbors confirmed safe and sound by volunteers. And 1,828 confirmed safe and sound through email and text as of Wednesday, October 2nd. If you want to volunteer, please report anytime between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. to our Registered Office located at 205-COSMO. This is where your help and assistance will be available. We're continuing to find people. Small donations of food, water, toiletries, baby formula, dog food, et cetera, can be dropped off as well. And they would take that out with them when they go out on those checks for neighbors.



Buncombe County has opened two new water and food distribution sites. They're located at King Creek Middle School at 570 Lower Brush Creek Road in Fletcher and Lester Elementary. school at 31 Gilbert Road in Leicester. It will be open noon to 4 p.m. and will have water and ready-to-eat meals. Bring your own water containers. The other locations where you can get water and meals ready to eat are William Estes Elementary School at 275 Overlook Road in Asheville, Sandhill Elementary at 154 Sandhill School Road in Asheville. Please remember to enter from the Acton Circle location, North Windy Ridge Intermediate School at 20 Donner Road in Weaverville, Fairview Elementary School, 1355 Charlotte Highway in Fairview, and Black Mountain Ingalls, 550 NC9 in Black Mountain.



A public AT&T mobile connectivity station has been set up at the Sam's Club at 645 Patton Avenue in Asheville. Folks can access chargers, use computers, and have service for calls. Big Ivy Community Center at 540 Dillingham Road in Barnardsville received several trucks of emergency supplies from Operation Airdrop yesterday, with more arriving today. This includes partial emergency items, food, water, and limited supplies of hay and feed for livestock. If you are in need of emergency supplies, please reach out to us at the Big Ivy Community Center today, October 3rd, starting at noon, cooking hamburgers and hot dogs until they run out of food. Please bring to-go containers if possible and extras to share with those who are stranded. Many in the area are still without power and water.



Volunteers with four-wheelers are willing to hike, and are needed to help distribute supplies. You can also drop off or pick up donations at Barnardsville Elementary School at 20 State Road, 2170 in Barnardsville. Urgent needs include volunteers, porta-potties, especially those that are ADA-accessible, bleach, mold cleaner, personal protective equipment, gas, propane, Coleman stoves, and more along that line. Buncombe County Adult Home Specialists have contacted all assisted care facilities that they monitor to assess their needs, and we have contact with around 60 facilities. All facilities have been reached. Most facilities are without power. However, they have been able to meet their own needs. The pharmacies have been great in delivering medications. The biggest needs are water and gas for generators, and our teams are submitted these requests to the Emergency Operations Center, and fully anticipate being able to meet those needs quickly.



Staff are working to make contact with all of their clients to make sure that they have their needs met. When you are donating items to community donation centers, don't forget to consider supplies that older adults might need like incontinence supplies. Staff are also conducting general outreach to all seniors in our community. We have contacted 301 seniors, identified their needs, and we are working with our registered aides and the United Way to fill these needs. We are also working with them to expand wellness checks for the folks we could not get in touch with. We do not have an update number for loss of lives to provide this morning. The Sheriff will be joining this afternoon at 4 p.m. to provide that update.



Next, we will be joined by FEMA National Incident Management Assistance Team Lead, Mary Ann Tierney. Thank you. Good morning. My name is Mary Ann Tierney. I'm with FEMA. I'm the National Incident Management Assistance Team Lead that is assigned to Buncombe County. The first thing I want to say is that our thoughts are with the people of Western North Carolina. This is a very devastating event. I had an opportunity yesterday to travel around with the County Emergency Management Director to see firsthand the level of damage and devastation it is significant. The recovery is going to take a long time and FEMA will be here for the duration of the response and the recovery. A couple of things that I wanted to highlight. Our number one priority continues to remain remains to be life safety.



As the County Manager mentioned, search and rescue is active and ongoing throughout the county. I also want to encourage people if you're safe and able to do so to please register for FEMA assistance. There are two ways to do that. You can call 1-800-621-7000. You can call 1-800-621-7000. You can call 1-800-621-7000. That's 1-800-621-FEMA. That's 1-800-621-FEMA. Or you can go to disasterassistance.gov. That's all one word, disasterassistance.gov. Registering for FEMA assistance is a critical first step in the recovery process. FEMA has several programs that are available immediately to assist you with emergent needs. One program is called Serious Needs Assistance. This is cash that can help you with life sustaining and life saving supplies like food, water and medical equipment or supplies.



There's also displacement assistance. If you cannot be in your house, there is funding that could be available if you're eligible to stay in a hotel or to stay with friends and family. So I encourage people to apply for assistance. Later on, well actually since yesterday and continuing, we will have disaster survivor assistance teams throughout Buncombe County. We have more people flowing in to support that effort. So you should see FEMA people in your neighborhood helping you register. Those folks will have access to care. So if you're in a community that's in need of assistance, they will be able to help you. They will be able to help you with your communications so that if you cannot register yourself due to your communications outages, they will be able to register you for assistance. So be on the lookout for individuals in FEMA attire and vest that will register you for assistance. And with that, I am complete and I will turn it back over to the county.



Thank you, Marianne. And we will open the briefing up to questions from the media.



This is Keith Campbell from National Watchdog. A moment ago, there was a reference to FEMA assistance teams in the area. How many team members are there in Buncombe County right now? All right. We have about five teams right now, and they're primarily focusing on the points of dispensing. So as people receive supplies, they are registering for assistance. Over the next few days, as we receive more teams, we'll be fanning out throughout the community, including areas that are typically hard to hit. As long as it's safe for our staff to travel, they will go into communities and to neighborhoods and register people. Thanks. But I have a follow-up. Team members, you mentioned there are teams here, but how many members per team?



Can you give us a total for what you have now and what you expect to be coming and when that additional, source will be here? A DSA crew has typically eight people. We can follow up and get you the specifics on where our teams are today, and also how many are actually working today. I think that would be important information, especially because they're at the pods. And so it'd be helpful to get the word out about their location so that people can register for assistance. Thank you. Hi, it's Laura Lee at Blue Ridge Public Radio. Before you step away, I was going to try to catch you. Can you just help us understand the distinction here? We've got FEMA teams on the ground registering people for- For assistance.



But can you talk about the operations that FEMA is doing, particularly in terms of supplying actual water and food on the ground? Yeah, that's a great question. So FEMA does a variety of things in a disaster response. One thing we do is provide commodities through staging areas. So commodities are food and meals ready to eat in this particular instance. That's done in concert with our state and local emergency management partners. So we have a staging area with those supplies. And then as- And then as the state and the county and local officials need them, then we will distribute them to the state and local officials. And then they operate the points of dispensing where the supplies are actually given out. Katie Hillen with News 13. This may be a FEMA question or a county question. Just wondering, does Mission Hospital have water now? If so, how did that come about? And if not, what's the plan? Absolutely. I believe that would be a question for the county.



We will get your more updated answer. But from my understanding, the last time we spoke, Mission did have water being trucked in, similar to what you've seen at the pods, distribution sites. They've been using a private company to bring water to Mission. So does that mean they actually have water coming out of the spigots and toilets flushing, or that means water is just being trucked in? I don't have a more detailed answer. I just know that they have water being trucked in. We will research that and get that answer for you. Okay. Hello. Virginia Bridges from the News and Observer. I was hoping that you could walk us through the process for county officials as they're confirming these deaths, starting from the ground where they're finding them to where it's reported to us.



Could you explain how that works? I will defer that question to when the sheriff is with us this afternoon. Manager Pinder, it's Laura Lee at Blue Ridge Public Radio. A couple of questions for you. One is about sewage. We've talked a lot about the water. And can you talk to us about people who are not having water clearly creates difficulties on the sewer system. Can you talk about that at all? No, I don't have any knowledge on the sewer system. We'll defer that to MSD. And they'll be joining us tomorrow, I'm being told. Okay. What about the potential for public health issues from the lack of water and sanitation services right now? Is there a plan for a potential sort of impending public health situation? Not at this time, Laura Lee.



I believe that I would get that answer from Ellis. I'm looking at my team. They're taking notes. I'm like, oh, I don't have any leadership. I'm like, oh, I don't have as you're asking your questions so we can make sure we bring the information you're looking for. Great, just a couple more. We talked yesterday about non-potable water from the JCC. Are there other sources of non-potable water for people who need it? Not at this time. We've been working diligently to find a provider that would truck watering as well for non-potable. So people are not using the drinking water for flushing toilets. I've not been successful. The team is still looking for non-potable.



So as we reached out and talking on the medias, if anyone out there has a non-potable source of water, please call the EOC and we will look to see if we can find some contracts. But finding non-potable has been harder than we thought. Is the FEMA representative, I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name, Marian. Do you have any sort of non-potable water that we could have here? Yeah, that's a great question. Actually, that's something that we've been discussing with the county and also is being discussed in Raleigh at the State Emergency Operations Center, a way to distribute in bulk non-potable water so people can do things. Things like clean their plates and flush their toilets. Do we have a timeframe on that? Oh yeah, do you have a timeline on that?



I do not. That's something that I would defer back to North Carolina Emergency Management. Okay, and then- I will say real quick, we have been working closely with the state on other supplies. So as soon as we get a timeline, we'll get that to you. And I see- Can I ask about mobile distribution of- Oh, sorry, go ahead. I see Lillian stepping up. Maybe she has an answer on one of your questions from previously. Yeah, Lillian Govis, Director of Communications and Public Engagement. Just wanted to give an update on MSD. That plant has been operational the entire time and they have been treating the entire time. They have 37 out of 40 pump stations that are working either with backup power or with full power.



And so they've got a few transmission lines that have leaks and breakages and they're working on repair. But they're making a lot of progress and our sewage district has been operational throughout this entire disaster. So if people are able to get water from places like creeks and other non-potable water sources, then they should be able to flush toll. It's no problem for the vast majority. Is that what we're saying? Yeah, that's correct. Great. My other question was about mobile distribution of water. We've talked about distribution points and I think, forgive me the time, I don't know which day, if it was yesterday, or the day before, but where are we on mobile distribution of water to people who are unable to access those distribution points? That question is very timely.



So just this morning, we had a meeting with county and city of Asheville officials to talk about direct delivery of supplies. So that is a project that the county is working on and FEMA will be supporting that with personnel resources. And I don't have a specific timeline on when that will start, but it will be in the coming days. Okay. Manager Pender, as you can imagine, it's frustrating for people to hear that there are meetings about this when they're existing without water for several days if they're elderly or vulnerable and cut off. Does the county have any response to the delays that we've seen in mobile water distribution? Yes, as I mentioned in my talking points at the top of this, we have reached out to all of those seniors and nursing homes and we're taking water to those places where masses of people are gathered.



So we are taking water there. We have worked with a couple of nonprofits to get them up to speed so we can get them to take water out as well. To Marianne's point, planning is important. I hear you when you say there's delays, but planning is important. We work really hard to get those points of distribution so that people that have the ability can come so we can serve lots of people. But through those, those distribution points and that has been happening, now we're going down the line and making sure people that can't get here is getting water. But first we went large and now we're whittling down to make sure people can get what they need if they can't get to us. And as Marianne, that's within the next couple of days.



So I hear you with the delays and I understand that and it breaks my heart that we couldn't do everything all at once, but we have been working hard to make sure we can serve our community and serve our community well. And to those points that you're saying you've taken water out where people are sort of in mass, nursing homes, et cetera, does that include any public housing? And do you have any other comments on access to basic necessities for people in public housing? Yes. And if you recall earlier, one of these, I forget how many days we've been doing these now, but one of those, we told you that our community paramedics has been going door to door in our public housing to make sure people had water.



They were taking bottle of water with them as they were going door to door in our public housing complex. So yes, ma'am, that has also been on our list. I have a water related question. Yesterday, at the four o'clock briefing, Deborah Campbell said that the city had enough water to last through Friday. Has that changed? Is there additional water or additional length of time that water will be available? Water will be available. We have contracted as well and they're replenishing as we empty one of those tankers, they're replenishing them for us. I believe our water supply right now is coming out of Spartanburg. South Carolina. So when we finish, I don't remember the number of those large tankers we have on site. I want to say about 10.



So as soon as one is finished, that can go back and make it to Spartanburg and bring back water. So we do have a supply of water and we continue. I've said before, we will continue to provide that water to our community. We also have the water coming from our state now on a regular basis. So we do have bottle water that is coming in. We had some nonprofits to also supply water to our community. So our rural central kitchen is here bringing water as well. So I do believe we have a supply of water and it's no more consistent that we have water. So we will continue to provide water both to the city sites as well as to the county sites.



And then are we still saying that do we have a better timeline for residents who don't have water? Are we still saying weeks? Can you provide any more information about that? That would be a question that we'll direct to the city staff. They're on the four o'clock briefing tomorrow for full details. But we're still saying that we have water. But Ben would be here in the afternoon to answer any specific questions on the water distribution from the city's plan. Yes. Patricia from Enlace Latina NC. There is people in the community that have seen that border patrol cars. I know that it's not about the Hong Kong County thing, but people in the community are worried about that. The information that we have is there. So I'm here for helping, but it will be important to hear about that from you so we can bring the information to the Latino community about that.



OK, thank you. I also saw border patrol officers providing security. Their mission is security related. ICE and border patrol are not conducting enforcement operations. In the area. OK, thank you. We also have another question from Walter Gomez of Enlace. To bring peace of mind to the Latino community, can FEMA, Marianne, please explain their work in the area and if they have bilingual personnel? Yeah, I'll take the bilingual question first. So FEMA will translate all of its all of its materials are available in Spanish, and we are aware of the languages that are spoken throughout the county. So we will be working to ensure that we can meet the language access needs of people within the county.



In terms of the border patrol officers that are here, they are providing security on behalf of FEMA forces like the urban search and rescue teams and also at the request of the state and the county. And so they are again, ICE and border patrol are not conducting enforcement operations in the area. Laura, I'm Laura Lee at BPR again. I want to ask about internet service, cell service. We have these temporary measures you described, Manager Pender about access points. Do we have any sort of information from the companies about how much longer people are going to have to rely on those temporary points of access? Unfortunately not. We don't have any information yet on how long it will take to put those towers back up.



However, we are sure that one of the things Helen Chikering from BPR has asked about portable toilets for the community. Are there any updates on these kinds of availability, and is FEMA helping with that? I don't believe that is on FEMA's list yet at this point in time. We are working on those toilets, as you mentioned. There are a few already deployed. I know the city has them at their sites in the city limits, and we're also looking. That has been a top commodity to get more toilets in, but we are working on putting those at our distribution sites as well across the county. Lucas Tomei with Carolina Public Press saw yesterday that President Biden approved mobilization of active duty military to affected areas.



I'm just wondering if any of those troops have arrived and what their role will be once they reach Buncombe County. Yeah, that's a great question. So as I mentioned earlier, that we would have federal personnel that would be able to do support the delivery of commodities directly to individuals, and that is one of the missions that we are scoping for those soldiers. Is there any update on the or information on the Chemtronics Superfund site? Any information about the concerns related to environmental concerns related to that or health concerns related to that? I haven't heard any concerns. Can you share specifically what you're reading? Is that what you're referring to? Yeah, sure. We just have received questions about, you know, has that been breached? Is anyone testing the waters or the soil around that site? We'll take that question back, but I haven't. This is the first I'm hearing of that. So we'll research and get you an answer.



We had one question in the chat. We had one question about whether any of the county facilities sustained damage. Our teams are starting to do that damage assessment now. I haven't seen anything. We had some trees down, but we haven't heard anything coming back from that damage assessment team that is going out. We took all the staff we had first to make sure we had our community organized and get services out to our community, and now we're going back to reassess county operations.



I will say that we're currently, you know, in a couple of weeks, we'll have an election. So we're also working on making sure we have the facilities and our early voting sites. That is our first priority as we go back to assessing county operations. The first priority would be making sure early voting sites are ready and available. We'll start working again on getting our full workers trained. So operation still has to happen, even though in the middle of a disaster. So we're trying to split our team. And we're so grateful to our state partners. To send crews in from across our state, across our nation now, to help us so that we can get our teams back to doing the regular work that they would normally be doing. This is Andy Rose with CNN. I apologize if I just missed it at the beginning, but is the confirmed fatality toll in Buncombe County still 61? I don't have an updated number this morning, Andy. The sheriff will be here at four o'clock and he will bring us any updated loss of lives in our community.

Again, I have been reading that people aren't getting all of the official updates being sent out by Buncombe County and/or City of Asheville, so I'm posting the update emailed out around 20 minutes ago. As always, stay safe and stay strong!

If they send me a Spanish version I will edit my post to include it. I have tried to add some quick formatting to make it easier to read, since they sent it mostly unformatted. Here is the full text:

Last night, water flowed in Downtown Asheville, which is significant progress, and a direct result of the hard, long hours water crews have been working.¬†

The Buncombe County Board of Commissioners will meet virtually today at 5 p.m. The meeting can be viewed live on the Buncombe County Facebook page.¬†

With current dry conditions, officials urge people to follow safe fire practices including keeping burn piles small under 6 feet, staying away at least 15 feet from structures and wooded areas, and having a way to extinguish the fire nearby, such as water, a shovel, or an extinguisher.¬†

# Spectrum Restoration¬†

More than 236,000 NC Spectrum customers lost service at the height of the storm. In‚ÄØNC, Spectrum expects complete restoration to all locations that have power and are safe to access by‚ÄØSaturday, October 19. In Buncombe, 58% of Spectrum customers have seen their service restored, and 37,656 customers remain without power.¬†

# Duke Energy¬†

In Buncombe County, 3,247 remain without power as of Tuesday morning. Crews continue to make progress this week in restoring power. If you see a utility crew, please slow down and watch out for trucks and workers. Some homes may get power but then lose it. If this happens, it is recommended that they text OUT to 57801, report online, or call 800.POWERON (800.769.3766). Duke has a Western North Carolina Operation Center that facilitates ongoing collaboration with local government and Duke remains fully staffed.¬†

# U.S. Army Corps of Engineers¬†

Mission priorities in the region for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers include temporary power, debris, and infrastructure assessments. There are 250 members on the ground at all impacted areas. They have installed 16 generators, but with power coming back, those are being phased out. Teams are also performing assessments for the scope of work for the removal of the estimated 10 million cubic yards of debris.¬†

Post-Hurricane Helene, Corps permits are necessary for any work, including construction and dredging, in navigable waters. You do not need a permit from the Army Corps for debris, tree removal, sediment removal, certain bridge structures and cutting vegetations in streams, rivers, or wetlands. During storm events, if previously existing structures in waters/wetlands are damaged, those can typically be replaced and are exempt from Clean Water Act permitting. For more information, email [NCPermit-Wetlands@usace.army.mil](mailto:NCPermit-Wetlands@usace.army.mil), call (828) 271-7980 or (252)740-5719, or visit 151 Patton Ave.¬†

# FEMA¬†

# Health and Human Services¬†

The Buncombe County Health and Human Services Board has waived fees for vaccinations for flu, COVID, Tdap, and hepatitis A for adults.¬†

People impacted by Hurricane Helene can apply to receive a one-time benefit to help buy food through the Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or D-SNAP. To apply, visit [epass.nc.gov](http://epass.nc.gov/) or call 1-844-453-1117.¬†

# Fraud and Scams¬†

The North Carolina Attorney General's Office has a hotline to report scams including disaster repairs, price gouging, and fraud contractors. Call (877) 5-NO-SCAM toll-free within North Carolina or file a complaint online.¬†

**Important Tips:**¬†

If a housing inspector claims to represent FEMA, ask them to show you their identification badge. Federal employees always wear an official government badge to identify themselves.¬†

Don‚Äôt trust someone who asks for money. Federal and local disaster workers do not solicit or accept money. FEMA and U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) staff never charge applicants for disaster assistance, inspections, or help in filling out applications.¬†

Always work with licensed or verified contractors backed by reliable references, do not pay more than half the costs of repairs in advance, and demand that contractors detail the job to be done with guarantees in writing.¬†

If you suspect fraud, call the FEMA Disaster Fraud Hotline at 1-866-720-5721.¬†

# Assistance Hotline for Farmers¬†

The N.C. Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services hotline is active. This hotline is to connect farmers with resources that can assist with damage and other agricultural emergencies related to the storm. The toll-free number is‚ÄØ1-866-645-9403. A live operator will be available on the hotline between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.¬†

# Solid Waste¬†

County debris collection is beginning today in the Swannanoa area. Multiple passes will be needed for debris cleanup, and this is the start of what will be a long process.¬†

Wednesday, Oct.15: WastePro will run normal routes for household trash and recycling at accessible locations in Swannanoa.‚ÄØ WastePro will also have trucks located at Owen Pool at 117 Stone Drive in Swannanoa from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. for household trash on Wednesday only.

Help Rebuild My Art After Hurricane Helene

Dear Friends, Family, and Art Lovers,

My name is Brent aka glassblowingb and I am a local artist based in Asheville, North Carolina. I have dedicated the last two decades creating art that reflects this unique community, but recently, I faced an unimaginable loss. Due to the devastating effects of Hurricane Helene, I lost all of my artwork that was displayed in the River Arts District Marquee.

The impact of this hurricane has been overwhelming. My artwork represents not only my passion but also countless hours of hard work, creativity, and love. Losing it has not only affected me emotionally but has also made it incredibly difficult to support myself as an artist during this challenging time.

While I am hopeful that FEMA will provide assistance, I need your help to get back on my feet in the meantime. I am reaching out to you to help me rebuild what was lost. Your contributions will go directly towards:

- Creating new artwork to replace what I lost
- Covering basic living expenses while I navigate this recovery process
- Materials and supplies necessary for my artistic practice

I am so grateful for any support you can offer, whether it‚Äôs a donation, sharing this campaign with your network, or simply reaching out with messages of encouragement. Every little bit helps, and together, we can rebuild not just my art, but my spirit.

Thank you for your kindness and support during this difficult time. I look forward to sharing my new creations with you all soon.

With gratitude,

Brent Earnest

Asheville Alert 10/16 4:00pm: Another slight update to the Systemwide Boil Water Notice,"The City of Asheville sent out yet another alert that looks pretty similar to the last two. However, they included guidance for washing dishes and specified that the water should not be used for home food prep. Here is the new stuff:

* Water can be used for flushing toilets, laundry, bathing, and washing hands for basic personal hygiene ***but not for home or commercial food preparation.***
* Guidance for washing dishes**:**
   * Dishwasher: If your dishwasher has a sanitizing cycle or reaches a final rinse temperature of at least 170¬∞F (66¬∞C), you can use it. Check your dishwasher's manual or contact the manufacturer to confirm.¬†
   * Hand-washing dishes: Wash and rinse dishes using hot water, then soak them in a solution of 1 tablespoon of unscented bleach per gallon of warm water for at least one minute. Allow the dishes to air dry completely before using them again.¬†
   * Disposable items: If possible, use disposable plates, cups, bowls, and flatware.¬†

In case people missed yesterday's or want to review the whole alert themselves, I will post the full text of the alert as well as the Spanish version below. You're all doing great out there! Keep it up!

# English full text

The City of Asheville Water Resources Department is issuing a **Boil Water Notice for all City of Asheville water customers** due to loss of pressure in distribution system pipes and levels of turbidity (particles) in the water. If you receive this message, you are under a Boil Water Notice.

A **Boil¬† Water Notice** means there is contamination due to impacts from Hurricane Helene including the potential for untreated water in the distribution system from pipe breaks and levels of turbidity that exceed Safe Drinking Water Act standards initially used to restore water pressure. Your water may look cloudy and/or have a chlorine odor.¬†

It is **Required** for customers to vigorously boil tap water for 1 minute before consuming it. Once laboratory testing of the system confirms the possibility of risk is not present, customers will receive notification that the boil water notice has been lifted via the same method you received this notice.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

El Departamento de Recursos H√≠dricos de la Ciudad de Asheville ha emitido un Aviso sobre hervir agua para todos los clientes por p√©rdida de presi√≥n en las tuber√≠as del sistema de distribuci√≥n y niveles de turbiedad (part√≠culas) en el agua. Si recibe este mensaje, se encuentra bajo un Aviso de Hervir agua.¬†

Un Aviso sobre hervir agua significa que hay contaminaci√≥n debido a los impactos del hurac√°n Helene, incluido el potencial de agua no tratada en el sistema de distribuci√≥n debido a roturas de tuber√≠as y niveles de turbidez que exceden los est√°ndares de la Ley de Agua Potable Segura utilizados inicialmente para restaurar la presi√≥n del agua. Su agua puede verse turbia y/o tener olor a cloro.¬†

Es Obligatorio que los clientes hiervan vigorosamente el agua del grifo durante 1 minuto antes de consumirla. Una vez que las pruebas de laboratorio del sistema confirmen que no existe posibilidad de riesgo, los clientes recibir√°n una notificaci√≥n de que el aviso de hervir el agua se ha levantado mediante el mismo m√©todo en el que recibi√≥ este aviso.¬†

**¬øD√≥nde pueden acudir los clientes para obtener informaci√≥n?**

Para obtener m√°s informaci√≥n, llame al 828-251-1122 o visite el sitio web de la ciudad de Asheville.¬†[www.ashevillenc.gov/helene](http://www.ashevillenc.gov/helene).¬†

**El agua se puede utilizar para tirar de la cadena de los inodoros, lavarse las manos, lavar la ropa y ba√±arse. Durante el ba√±o, vigile a los ni√±os peque√±os para asegurarse de que no beban el agua accidentalmente. A los beb√©s se les pueden dar ba√±os de esponja.**¬†

**Guia para lavar los trastes:**

**Lavavajillas:** Si tu lavavajillas tiene un ciclo de desinfecci√≥n o alcanza una temperatura de enjuague final de al menos 170¬∞F (66¬∞C), puedes usarlo. Consulta el manual de tu lavavajillas o contacta al fabricante para confirmar.¬†

**Lavado a mano de los trastes:** Lava y enjuaga los trastes usando agua caliente, luego sum√©rgelos en una soluci√≥n de 1 cucharada de cloro sin aroma por cada gal√≥n de agua tibia durante al menos un minuto. Deja que se sequen al aire completamente antes de usarlos nuevamente.¬†

**Art√≠culos desechables:** Si es posible, usa platos, vasos, tazones y cubiertos desechables.  
  
**¬øQu√© hacer antes de que regrese el servicio de agua?**

Love Asheville From Afar - User-Friendly Roundup of Local Businesses to Support!,"Forgive me if this has been posted already - I saw that it was included in [this awesome post](https://www.reddit.com/r/asheville/comments/1fz9736/roundup_of_places_to_support_local_artists/) but I wanted to make a special spotlight for this project, as it applies to all sorts of local business and nonprofits even outside of the arts.

ExploreAVL put together [this website](https://always.exploreasheville.com/love-asheville) where you can browse a database of local businesses and find links to donate or shop online. I have seen a lot of discussion about the impacts of lost revenue from our biggest tourism month (October) and ways to support small businesses and artists during these times. This is such an awesome tool to introduce out-of-towners to our local businesses! You can sort by different categories or even search by keyword. If you have friends and relatives getting started on their holiday shopping, please send them this link! Or if you are a local artist / business / nonprofit affected by the storm, you can fill out the google form linked at the top of the page to add your listing. They are updating it all the time (my workplace submitted and it just took a few days for the listing to go up!) Shoutout to the ExploreAVL team for putting this together.

Unfortunately I don't know if the database includes businesses from surrounding areas, but I don't think it does... For adjacent towns, another way for out-of-towners to support businesses is to explore via Google Maps in Black Mountain, Marshall, etc. and click on business websites to find out if they sell online. This is just an idea off the top of my head, if anyone knows of similar websites or lists for other WNC towns, please let me know in the comments, I would love to share those too :D",https://www.reddit.com/r/asheville/comments/1g7im8x/love_asheville_from_afar_userfriendly_roundup_of/,1729371702.0,kiyyeisanerd,asheville,"[{'Comment Author': 'AutoModerator', 'Comment Body': 'Hey u/kiyyeisanerd, it looks like you asking or commenting about the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.

"üéß ""We can only mail to the original billing address"" üòµ","Anyone else having problems replacing documentation or just stuff....because the company customer service support  keeps saying they will only mail it to the original billing address and if we want to update our address, we have to send proof of address with our name on the ""Bill"" which can't be done if we're in a shelter or a hotel room paid by FEMA or we're in a tent or a car or an RV parked on the road or on the muddy lot where the home used to be üòµ‚Äçüí´


Thankfully the supervisor for the hotel I'm in (paid by FEMA) understood the situation and gave me an invoice with my name on it just so I could get a new SIM card for my new phone because they mailed out the wrong SIM card and Then mailed the new SIM card to the old address even though I told them I'm not there and they told me ""No problem.

Forgivness and compassion for those who lost their battle with themselves,"A lot of us before this evebt had a number of life difficulties and magnified fears. With such an intense election, a constant ‚Äúwill I be replaced or laid off‚Äù and the ever increasing fear that the economy is rigged against us, many of our community members (our brothers and sisters) fell for an answer that aligned with the worst part of their negativity.

All of us have senses for a while the uneasiness of life in the present moment and in small ways contribute to it at large with lashing out, slander or anger.

For those of you related or know someone who has lost themselves in the much that is on the internet, if you have the patience, talk to them about their opinions, believes or thoughts in a neutral manner, asking questions and listening. Many of these individuals were already suffering before Hurricane Helene and in their grief may be feeling emotionally unregulated and willing to believe these poor answers brought before them as Gospel to justify behavior that is beneath them.

I want to try contacting fema about repairing it, but I‚Äôm on a month to month lease and the landlord would 100% use this as a reason to kick me out and keep my deposit.

I live alone in a crappy one bedroom house that‚Äôs well below market rate. During the storm, the kitchen ceiling started leaking (roof is old af) and ended up filling a five gallon bucket. I‚Äôve kept fans and fresh air flowing, and dehumidified constantly once the power came back on, but mold keeps blooming where the leak was and spreading further out. The drywall has to be cut out and replaced. 

I can‚Äôt afford to move, and can‚Äôt qualify for a new lease anyway; I‚Äôm self employed and work completely froze until this week‚Ä¶ but I only earned $200. I don‚Äôt know how long it will be until I‚Äôm earning what I used to (which still isn‚Äôt much) and job hunting for something in the meantime has been pretty bleak.

I applied for fema in the first couple days, and just now got a message from an agent saying they want to inspect. But I also have a friend of a friend who‚Äôs already volunteered to repair the roof leak and replace moldy part of the ceiling without telling the landlord, I would have to pay out of pocket for it but it‚Äôd be a lot cheaper than moving. 

Is it worth risking my stable-ish housing to get aid from fema, when I don‚Äôt own the property? I assume all of the repair money would go to the landlord.

In an ideal world the landlord would do the right thing and I‚Äôd use a hotel voucher while he uses the fema money for mold remediation and a little rent forgiveness, then I‚Äôd move back in, and we‚Äôd all hug and celebrate human rights‚Ä¶ but in reality, he‚Äôs going to take all the fema money, promptly end my lease, redo the whole kitchen and put the house back on the market for $3500/mo. I‚Äôd use the last of my emotional stability trying to take him to court, and capitalism will march forward without me.

Has fema offered anyone relocation assistance when the house isn‚Äôt 100% destroyed? What did that look like and has it been effective help? Would my situation qualify? My biggest concern is if I don‚Äôt tell fema or the landlord, the mold could still come back or he could just end my lease on a whim, and the window for financial aid will be long gone.

Tree removal recs after Helene ,"Hey all,

I know so many people are dealing with much worse situations so I apologize if this query isn't welcome here.

A dead tree fell on our fence (South Asheville) during Helene. It's our neighbor's tree (neighbor is a commercial property behind our house). I had been meaning to ask them to remove it for months but never got around to it because I didn't know who the owner of the building was/was being lazy. Now i'm kicking myself because my understanding is they would only be responsible for clean up of a dead tree if I could prove they knew the tree was dead beforehand.

Does anyone have any recs for a tree removal service? I know everyone is probably super booked up with more pressing matters but I'd like to start at least getting something scheduled, even months out, since the longer the tree sits on our fence the more damage it causes.

Uncomfortable topic - homeowners insurance Hurricane coverage,"I read an article today about how <1% of people in Buncombe County have flood insurance.  I am part of that 99%. I thought we were covered, but as I double checked our policy the Wed before Helene, I realized we misinterpreted the wind and hail clause. Turns out an exclusion under exclusions does not mean the exclusion is excluded. Trying to figure it out made my head spin.

So IS flood, wind and hail, rain/flood, or named storm coverage even available in WNC? I checked the NC state insurance for Hurricane coverage, but you have to live in 1 of 13 coastal counties to get it. 

Who has coverage, and from which insurance company? What coverages should I have had to be completely covered for a storm like Helene?

Do we know the actual toll of Helene?,"Not looking to start a political storm here. At all.

I‚Äôm also not the morbid type. But I‚Äôm curious about the death toll from Helene. By day 7, the Buncombe radio updates reported 72. As of today, the official report is 42. This article explains how it dropped by 30, I guess. 

Obviously it may take months to know as there are still people missing and unaccounted for. But it seems weird to me, almost as if the local officials are being a bit cagey about the total number. And if they are, why?

The article also says a total of 11 in Yancey. Heart breaking. Heart crushing. And yet I hope it‚Äôs accurate, because it doesn‚Äôt line up with the stories I‚Äôve heard. And yes, I realize I just said ‚Äústories I‚Äôve heard.‚Äù Not reports, just 2nd or 3rd hand stories. But the videos online‚Äîyikes. I‚Äôd be stunned if the numbers in this article are accurate.

Freeze warning tonight/tomorrow morning for Asheville,"Heads up! The temperature in Asheville will dip to around 31¬∞F by 7:35am. The wind should make it feel even colder. Make sure you‚Äôre prepared. Fortunately, it will be brief. Stay warm!

*AB Tech Conference Center (use Victoria Road entrance)  
*Former Gold's Gym at 1815 Hendersonville Road (this location has a playground for kids and a suitable location for families. No pets are allowed.)  
*A-B Tech Campus at 10 Genevieve Cir. (medical emergency shelter, available for people that need medical equipment that require power)  
*WNC Ag Center at 1301 Fannon Bridge Road (good option for families with pets)

Homeowners and small business - be aware of scammy ‚Äúdisaster recovery‚Äù and reconstruction contractors.,"My family evacuated Asheville on Oct. 2 and everyone in WNC is weighing so hard on my heart.   I‚Äôm awake at 2am ruminating and felt the need to give a warning.

I had to deal with a (much less widespread) disaster in 2020.  The Nashville Christmas Day bombing.

After the bombing, residents and small business owners and restaurants were swarmed by ‚Äúdisaster recovery‚Äù companies.

They do half the job poorly and then cut and run.  The Nashville bomber blew up his RV and about a million lawsuits fluttered out.  

4 years later most places still aren‚Äôt rebuilt and a good part of that is because people got scammed and lost money in those first days after the disaster.  

All of the individuals and small businesses along the entire riverfront quickly hired companies that ‚Äúseemed‚Äù competent and had ‚Äúdone this before‚Äù. 

Your emotions are in a place that you so badly want to trust in someone who has done this before and who promises you‚Äôll be safe in their hands. 

You have a time crunch because you‚Äôre worried about (more) rain coming in your house or restaurant or store and getting toxic crap out of your house or restaurant or store.

These companies know you‚Äôre desperate, and worried, and that you need to hear that someone is confident that they can help dig you out.  After all, they‚Äôre experts.

And they are. At being scam artists.  They start the job to get first payment, maybe increasing the work orders here or there and adding a few more payments and then scampering away.  

Or, in our case. Charging our building of 33 units over a million dollars just for demo that they didn‚Äôt finish.  They let the building get broken into several times, rained in, and tried to sneakily not remove outlets and Sheetrock that had toxic ash in it.  When we refused to pay the full amount and wanted to negotiate a reasonable amount, they sued us (as a collective through our HOA).  Lawsuit STILL ongoing.

We are not the only building that happened to.  And it wasn‚Äôt just one company.  It‚Äôs an entire industry .

As soon as the roads open, they‚Äôre going to flock in and make you feel so relieved they‚Äôre there to help.  They‚Äôre not.

If you don‚Äôt have internet, try and at least call someone who does to do thorough research on companies before signing any disaster recovery contracts.   Try to find out if they often sue or are sued. Or go under many different d/b/as (‚Äúdoing-business-as‚Äù - meaning they change their name a lot to escape their own bad reputation ).

Please make others aware to try and watch out for these scummy companies.",https://www.reddit.com/r/asheville/comments/1fwks1s/homeowners_and_small_business_be_aware_of_scammy/,1728112381.0,Bugbear259,asheville,"[{'Comment Author': 'AutoModerator', 'Comment Body': 'Hey u/Bugbear259, it looks like you asking or commenting about the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
