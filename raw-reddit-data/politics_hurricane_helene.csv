If you present a conspiracy theory, you have to present the sources that you got it from or show why it's true or else news outlets must refer to it as false or unproven. For example, the people pushing pizza gate said Democrats were sexually abusing children in the basement of a pizza restaurant should have been required to take several news outlets to the pizza restaurant and do a tour of the basement where the alleged abuse was occurring. Of course, there was no basement in that restaurant nor abuse. At which point the reporters would ask the person spreading the rumor if he made up the rumor or is he just repeating it. Then the reporter would turn to the audience and say that no evidence whatsoever was found and the person appears to have made up the rumor to further an extremist political agenda. Also, until the conspiracy theory is determined to be real or false, it should be referred to as an unproven or false conspiracy theory. Any news outlet that allows the spread of conspiracy theories without solid proof or that fails to refer to it as an unproven conspiracy theory should be prosecuted. \n\nReinstate the Fairness Doctrine so opposing viewpoints are given equal time on the media. When a media outlet spouts conspiracy theories, adequate time should be given to people who can prove the source of it or why it is or isn't true. \n\nWe need to enforce the antitrust act so that billionaires cannot buy up all the media.""}, {'Comment Author': 'TristanIsAwesome', 'Comment Body': 'Unless it\'s a mass shooting at a school, in which case ""now\'s not the time""'}, {'Comment Author': 'steelhips', 'Comment Body': 'The rest of the world is asking that question too.'}, {'Comment Author': 'InterestingPoint8525', 'Comment Body': ""It's beyond fucking maddening at this point.

Many of them were incensed that the typically bipartisan priority had fallen victim to partisan squabbles at such a dire time.\n\n- Indeed, as the House and Senate’s top four leaders met last weekend to negotiate a deal to keep the government funded, they were forced to acquiesce to the demands of Congress’ most conservative fiscal hawks, whose votes were thought to be pivotal for passage. They quietly stripped the CR of almost all supplemental funding, including for FEMA, according to multiple House appropriators.\n\n- The closed-door negotiations left many of Congress’ biggest disaster aid advocates surprised and disappointed, and even top appropriators with jurisdiction over disaster funding said they were blindsided.\n\n- “I would have thought that if you were going to do something, disaster funding would’ve been one of the starting points.

That it\'s somehow man-made and part of some deep state operation to interfere in the election.\n\nIt\'s mind boggling. Climate change isn\'t man made according to these people, but *natural* disasters are being weaponized by the globalist, deep state liberal cabal.\n\nMusk\'s algorithms are elevating the loudest lunatics on the platform. These are right wing voices that pay for the privilege to promote the most outlandish, irrational, clickbait content. And what\'s worse, they earn an income while doing it. It\'s the monetization of misinformation, Muskbucks...\n\nThese are people whose sole job is to be terminally online, while they accuse ""the left"" of being lazy socialists. Proudly proclaiming themselves ""critical thinkers"" and ""independent journalists"" in their Twitter bios\n\nThere\'s a concerted effort on these platforms to exploit almost any incident, event or tragedy and spin it into a narrative that blames Democrats/Kamala Harris for every  conceivable crime or disaster.\n\n""Where is Kamala?"" Is trending, and the top paid conservative personalities are claiming that she hasn\'t even made a statement, and that she\'s sending billions to Ukraine while poor Americans receive nothing.\n\nThese are flagrant lies, but they stick. What\'s more, they get pushed to the top of your feed.\n\nHarris has made multiple statements, she\'s been helping to coordinate the response, FEMA efforts are underway, these states are receiving the disaster funding they desperately need.\n\nKeep in mind that some of the prominent Republicans pushing these messages have voted down or discouraged this funding in the past.\n\nAnd you know what\'s particularly ironic? That these are people calling for the stripping down of all government agencies, including the ones responsible for responding to these disasters. People who call all forms of government support ""communism,"" but when that support is desperately needed in their communities, it becomes not only mandatory, but not enough...\n\nAnd make no mistake, most of these people couldn\'t care less about the victims of Hurricane Helene, they\'re more interested in using them as props to increase engagement and promote a dangerously misinformed and partisan message. I mean, it\'s practically dystopian.\n\nThis kind of stuff has become normalized, people are so caught up in their social media routines and devoted to their online presence, that they\'ve become desensitized and borderline sociopathic, senselessly dedicated to their online personas and political crusades. \n\nThe other irony is that *this* is the actual man made operation. These people are participating in the actual scheme, in the real election interference, mindlessly toeing the line, contributing to the dumbing down of the general public. They are the ""irrational force"" that Walter Lippman was warning us about back in the 1920s. And Elon Musk is proudly enabling it.\n\nThe other consequence of this will be JD Vance, Donald Trump, and/or their spokespeople showing up to the next debate, press conference or televised interview with a handful of talking points that are just reiterations of this propagandistic content. It\'s a damn circus. These are deep seated societal issues, and I\'m afraid they\'re just going to get worse. I can\'t think of any immediate solution to these problems.

Trump is in serious legal trouble, but right-wing media is doing everything they can to downplay it.\n\nWhat\'s really wild is that if this were some random person you knew, maybe a co-worker or a neighbor, you\'d read the indictment and be like, ""Holy sh**, this guy really did lie to everyone!"" But because it\'s Trump, some people are still convinced the government is out to get him, no matter how many facts are laid out. It\'s mind-blowing.\n\nIf you want a clearer picture, check out the leaked Steve Bannon tape on Mother Jones or YouTube. And seriously, read the indictment—it’s 165 pages long, but worth it.

I also submitted my receipt for a chainsaw I purchased to remove limbs and that was covered as well. For those who bought a generator after the hurricane made landfall, they were able to submit their receipts for reimbursement as well.\n\nI was eligible for over $40k if I wanted to appeal the amount awarded but didn’t since insurance covered the roof replacement, fence, and window repairs.\n\nA lot of people in my area were declined FEMA assistance because they couldn’t follow simple application instructions. They wouldn’t provide pictures, details, or receipts.\n\nThe $750 was for immediate relief such as groceries and to get a room. Vouchers and reimbursement was also approved for hotel assistance but that wasn’t needed on my end so I declined.\n\nThe same people who couldn’t follow simple application instructions on FEMA’s website wouldn’t listen to me when I tried to help them fill it out correctly. So they in turn went around complaining that FEMA is a scam and wouldn’t help them.\n\nFEMA also came to my town to hand out cases of water, tarps and lumber to patch your roof, a cleanup kit, rakes, shovels, rubber gloves, and respirators. I received a text drove to the library downtown and they loaded the bed of my truck up with supplies.\n\nEdit: Everything provided to me from FEMA was not in loan format. It was direct deposited in my account about 15 days (I believe) from the date I applied. There were no conditions that I pay anything back.\n\nSome people I know were actually denied because they were too lazy to fill out the application online and wanted to call and speak to someone in person. So they waited 3+ hours on hold to get a representative. That and they did not keep and receipts and felt like they shouldn’t have to take pictures of their property to send to the government.

He self-mythologized his program\'s impact and his version of events became the ""truth.""\n\nYes, people were fooled and members of the press critiqued him. But Welles, being the showman that he was, manipulated events to mold himself into a larger-than-life figure.\n\nHere\'s a short lecture provided by Johns Hopkins University that discusses the program through a larger discussion of the power of sound and the radio: [https://youtu.be/eRgpuhIcMMY?si=5vWHC\\_yfYRLBS8up](https://youtu.be/eRgpuhIcMMY?si=5vWHC_yfYRLBS8up)\n\nEDIT: Welles\' *F for Fake* also includes clips of Welles discussing the radio program and includes fabricated radio excerpts that the film suggests occurred. If anything, Welles highlights exactly your point of people falling prey to stories and images. I have a PhD in Literature so I love stories and the many truths they teach. But my love of Literature also led me to understand how effective stories can be to turn good people into followers of evil and destruction. Even if a person finds that the image they\'re looking at is AI, they still see a truth embedded within it. And when I read a fictional novel or watch a movie, I see truths about humanity embedded within it. So I\'m not surprised that folks will look at the AI image, see something that they think reflects reality, and then share the image, even if they find out later that it is fake.

It\'s like mice in psychological tests pushing the happy-button and ignoring food until they die, except in this case it\'s these people\'s sense of reality being starved.\n\nI\'m reminded of something I\'ve seen happen too many times in various fandoms: People who get so invested in their own fanart or slashfic they they lose the ability to discern their headcanon from the actual canon - and then blame the show for failing to adhere to the alt-canon they\'ve constructed.

Once it was known that Al Qaeda was behind the attack, the drumbeat for war wasn't just coming from the WH, they were banging pretty damn loud from the chambers of Congress as well (Dems included). Bush and Cheney definitely pushed to go after Iraq from the beginning, if Gore had acted differently than I think then sure we wouldn't have gone to Iraq. Just don't get the sense he'd go to war over something he and the Clinton administration thought of as a law enforcement/international terrorism issue rather than a 'military' one needing the full might of the US military and its allies to combat.\n\n And no, I don't think he would have just sat on his hands. I think Gore would have tried to take a more measured approach like try to get the Taliban to hand over Bin Laden or impose more sanctions. Looking at the Clinton Adminstration's strikes against Bin Laden and Al Qaeda, most were done to hurt Bin Laden financially (they sent cruise missiles to destroy a tannery owned by Bin Laden), to remove capability to produce things like nerve gas, or to stop attacks in planning. Rarely did they go after Al Qaeda's bases in Afghanistan or Bin Laden himself. They didn't want to send 'expensive missiles' against the training camps because the generals advised that they were primitive and cheap. Clinton and others like Gore didn't want to hit Bin Laden directly over fears that missing him would enhance his stature and attacks in Afghanistan might lead to claims of 'a bomb-happy US govt'. Diplomatic efforts were mostly stymied, but they kept trying them in lieu of actually going after Bin Laden/Al Qaeda. Some of this was due to Saudi Arabia, some because of concerns of how it would look if we took sides in the Afghan civil war between the Northern Alliance and the Taliban. Gore \\*might\\* have given a green light to take covert action against Bin Laden, but I don't think that would have been enough at the time based on the mood in Congress or a good bit of the country. \n\n A source on how the Clinton admin handled things w/ Al Qaeda and Bin Laden: [https://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report\\_Ch4.htm](https://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report_Ch4.htm)\n\n It's all pure speculation of course, we're living in a world where Bush was elected.""}, {'Comment Author': 'RJE808', 'Comment Body': ""Oh, my bad.

As the storm continues to track north, President Biden and Vice President Harris remain focused on life-saving and life-sustaining response efforts throughout the Southeast. The President and Vice President are closely monitoring these efforts and are receiving regular briefings, including today, from senior Administration officials, including Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator Deanne Criswell.\n\n>Administration officials have been in contact with state and local officials before and during the storm and will continue to coordinate together during recovery efforts. At the President’s direction, FEMA Administrator Criswell is traveling to Florida this afternoon to assess the damage alongside other state and local officials. Administrator Criswell will also travel to Georgia and North Carolina in the coming days.\n\n>President Biden and Vice President Harris are praying for those who lost loved ones and for everyone impacted by this storm. Although the storm has weakened, the situation remains extremely dangerous, and the Administration continues to urge residents to heed the warnings of local officials and evacuate immediately if told to do so, as flooding and other hazards may still affect the region.\n\n>Consistent with the President’s direction for a robust and well-coordinated Federal response, the Administration has taken swift action to support Hurricane Helene preparedness, response, and recovery efforts. Specific actions taken include:\n\n*Approved Emergency Declarations Before Landfall*\n\n>* Before Helene made landfall, the Governors of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina submitted emergency declaration requests that President Biden swiftly approved. These declarations authorized FEMA to provide assistance for emergency measures to save lives, protect property, public health and safety, and fund other emergency response measures. The Federal government proactively pre-positioned personnel and resources across the region before Hurricane Helene made landfall, including power restoration teams for temporary emergency power, search and rescue equipment, meals, water, generators, and equipment to assist communities and states with impacts from the storm.\n* The Administration, through the Department of Health and Human Services, declared a Public Health Emergency for the states of Florida and Georgia. This gives the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ (CMS) health care providers and suppliers greater flexibility in meeting emergency health needs of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.\n\n*Supporting Ongoing Emergency Response Efforts*\n\n>* At the President’s direction, before Helene made landfall, 1,500 Federal personnel were deployed to the region.\n* Urban Search and Rescue has deployed a total of 14 teams (940 personnel) to affected states. In Florida, eight teams are positioned to respond, and all are equipped with Swift Water Rescue Capabilities. In Georgia, two teams with water capability have been deployed to support rescue operations. In North Carolina, four teams all equipped with Swift Water Rescue Capabilities are in place. \n* The U.S. Coast Guard crews will continue to respond with vessels and aircraft to assist search and rescue activities. Approximately 8,000 personnel are working on the Coast Guard response. They will continue to respond to urgent distress calls to save lives and assist those impacted by the storm.\n* The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has two teams prepositioned to provide temporary emergency power, with additional personnel deployed and other are prepared to deploy if needed. In addition to temporary emergency power, personnel will assist the states with infrastructure assessments, debris management and temporary roofing assistance as needed. They have activated six emergency operation centers in the region to coordinate operations.\n* The Department of Health and Human Services deployed two Health and Medical Task Forces to assist hospitals and other critical care facilities with any impacts as a result of the storm.\n* FEMA’s Surge Capacity Force is activated, which enables the deployment of additional disaster staff within the Department of Homeland Security and across the Federal interagency to assist in the areas impacted by the hurricane.\n* The Federal government pre-staged more than 2.7 million meals, 1.6 million liters of water, 50,000 tarps, 10,000 cots, and 20,000 blankets in the region to support sheltering needs in impacted communities.\n* FEMA pre-positioned tanker trucks with 70,000 gallons of diesel fuel and 40,000 gallons of gasoline to surge to impacted communities once the storm has passed to help alleviate any fuel shortages.\n* Prior to the storm, FEMA also helped source hundreds of ambulances to assist with the movement of any patients out of impacted hospitals or other facilities.\n\n*Supporting Communities and Infrastructure Following the Storm’s Impact*\n\n>* The Department of Energy’s Energy Response Organization is activated and closely monitoring impacts and restoration efforts related to Helene, including power, fuel, and supply chain interruptions.  Via the Electricity Sub-Sector Coordinating Council, the Department also works continuously with electric utilities across the country to strengthen post-storm power restoration efforts.\n* The Environmental Protection Agency is working closely with Federal, state, local, and Tribal partners to help protect water systems, prepare for debris management, and ensure facilities, including Superfund sites, maintain critical public health and environmental protections. EPA stands ready to mobilize additional staff after the storm passes and as clean up and recovery efforts begin. \n* The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has made information available from the HHS emPOWER program, a partnership between the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, to support public health emergency planning and response activities. The program provides valuable information on the number of Medicare beneficiaries who rely on electricity-dependent durable medical equipment and certain health care services, such as dialysis, oxygen tanks, or home health care, to help anticipate, plan for, and respond to the needs of at-risk residents in areas impacted by the storm. \n* The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) notified Public Housing Authorities, multifamily, and healthcare facility owners to implement all appropriate protocols to prepare for the storm and ensure the safety of their residents. HUD is and will continue to work with the Public Housing Authorities, multifamily, and healthcare owners and homelessness assistance partners to determine damage impact and resident displacement. HUD will also be developing vacancy lists of HUD-assisted projects that can be used to provide temporary and/or permanent housing to disaster survivors.\n* The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service approved Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services’ request to provide operational flexibilities in all of the state’s school lunch programs – which will enhance flexibilities for meal service during unanticipated school closures.\n* The Department of Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration aerial teams are being deployed to provide valuable observations of impacted communities to understand the scope of the storm damage and to support disaster response by Federal partners. To ensure navigational safety, NOAA experts work around-the-clock after a storm acquiring and processing data to speed the reopening of ports and waterways by verifying water depth and identifying dangers to navigation.\n* Additional personnel from the Department of Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Department of the Interior, Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Energy, and Department of Health and Human Services are deployed to assist with response and recovery efforts.'}, {'Comment Author': 'Able_Ad_458', 'Comment Body': ""I have friends in the NC mountains, and the situation there is dire.

Others accuse the administration of President Joe Biden of using federal disaster funds to help migrants in the country illegally, or suggest officials are deliberately abandoning bodies in the cleanup. Republican Congress member Marjorie Taylor Greene posted on X Thursday night: ""Yes they can control the weather. It\'s ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can\'t be done.""\n\n>The conspiracy theories come at a pivotal time for [rescue](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/north-carolina-searches-survivors-cut-off-by-hurricane-helene-2024-10-01/) and [recovery efforts](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/will-ashevilles-once-booming-riverfront-art-district-ever-recover-helene-2024-10-03/) following the storm, one of the deadliest U.S. hurricanes this century. And the [presidential election](https://www.reuters.com/topic/event/us-elections/) between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris is just over a month away.\n\n>Republicans and Democrats alike say the rumors are causing problems. ""I just talked to one Senator that has had 15 calls TODAY about why we don\'t stop ........ \'fill in the blank,\'"" said Kevin Corbin, a Republican in the North Carolina Senate - a state that is one of the hardest hit by Helene. ""98% chance it\'s not true and if it is a problem, somebody is aware and on it,"" he wrote on Facebook. ""I\'m growing a bit weary of intentional distractions,"" he added.\n\n>White House officials on Friday accused some Republican leaders and conservative media of intentionally peddling rumors to divide Americans in a way that could harm disaster relief efforts.""Disinformation of this kind can discourage people from seeking critical assistance when they need it most,"" a White House memo said. ""It is paramount that every leader, whatever their political beliefs, stops spreading this poison.""The memo highlighted a claim by Trump during a rally this week that Biden and Harris had used federal emergency funds ""on people that should not be in our country.""""This is FALSE,"" the memo said. ""No disaster relief funding at all was used to support migrants housing and services. None. At. All.""\n\n>In response to a request for comment for this article, the Trump campaign repeated accusations that FEMA funds had been spent on housing migrants in the country illegally. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has the funds for immediate response and recovery efforts for Helene, the White House memo said, and has provided millions of dollars in relief to those recovering.\n\n>FEMA has been the target of so many falsehoods it has set up a rumor response page on its website to try to tamp them down. Helene [slammed into Florida](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/by-mule-helicopter-volunteers-deliver-aid-helene-victims-2024-10-04/) a week ago and has killed over 200 people and devastated a half dozen states in the U.S. Southeast.

There’s five, six states and they’re getting no help from our federal government.\n\n“Because they have no money. Because their money’s been spent on people that should not be in our country.”\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is not able to move money from migrant resettlement schemes, known as the Shelter and Service Program, to other areas because this is decided by an Act of Congress.\n\nIn 2024, for example, the DHS Appropriations Act allocated $640.9 million to the resettlement program to relieve pressure on migrant holding facilities.\n\nThe Harris campaign fired back at Trump on Friday, saying he had “gutted” FEMA during his time in the White House by diverting $150 million to border security.\n\nAmid the row over FEMA funding, Greg Abbott, the governor of Texas, also claimed this week that Mr. Mayorkas should simply move funds from migrant resettlement programs over to hurricane relief.\n\n“This is easy. Mayorkas and FEMA – immediately stop spending money on illegal immigration resettlement and redirect those funds to areas\xa0[hit by the hurricane](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/10/02/car-industry-choke-point-us-hurricane-microchip-mine/),” he said. “Put Americans first.”\n\n**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2024/10/04/trump-money-hurricane-relief-spent-migrants/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/news/2024/10/04/trump-money-hurricane-relief-spent-migrants/)'}, {'Comment Author': 'brain_overclocked', 'Comment Body': 'Here is a rough timeline and the whole of government response to Hurricane Helene recovery efforts:\n\nOct. 3:\n\n* [Remarks by President Biden on Response and Recovery Efforts Following Hurricane Helene | Ray City, GA](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/10/03/remarks-by-president-biden-on-response-and-recovery-efforts-following-hurricane-helene-ray-city-ga/)\n\nOct. 2:\n\n* [FACT SHEET: UPDATE: Biden-\u2060Harris Continues Life-Saving Response Efforts in Response to Hurricane Helene](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/10/02/fact-sheet-update-biden-harris-continues-life-saving-response-efforts-in-response-to-hurricane-helene/)\n\n* [Remarks by President Biden Before an Operational Briefing on the Impacts of Hurricane Helene | Raleigh, NC](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/10/02/remarks-by-president-biden-before-an-operational-briefing-on-the-impacts-of-hurricane-helene-raleigh-nc/)\n\n* [Remarks by Vice President Harris on Response and Recovery Efforts Following Hurricane Helene | Augusta, GA](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/10/02/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-on-response-and-recovery-efforts-following-hurricane-helene-augusta-ga/)\n\n* [President Joseph R.

Three projects – in Phoenix, AZ, Chicago, IL, and Providence, RI – received awards from both programs, following through on the Department’s commitment to invest in non-traditional, multimodal projects that have been challenging to fully fund with limited resources in the past.   \n...  \nSince the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, nearly $12.8 billion in funding through the INFRA and Mega programs has been announced for 140 projects across 42 states, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico, including approximately: \n\n>* 35 large bridge projects \n* 18 large port projects \n* 20 rail projects \n* 85 highway improvement projects \n\n>Approximately 53% of projects that have received funding to date are in rural communities, and about 42% of projects are located in disadvantaged communities, delivering on President Biden’s Justice40 commitment. \n\n>In today’s round of selections for the Mega program, the Biden-Harris Administration is investing $1.68 billion into 11 projects that will generate national and regional economic, mobility, and safety benefits while creating U.S. jobs and lowering costs for consumers.\n\n*Selected Mega projects this round include:*\n\n>* $472.3 million to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority for the North Station Renovation and Draw 1 Bridge Replacement project in Boston, Massachusetts. The project will replace Draw 1 – a 92-year-old bridge that links Amtrak’s Downeaster intercity passenger rail (IPR) service and four separate MBTA regional rail lines to North Station – as well as extend and activate a two-track platform at North Station and replace track, signals, and switches throughout the project area. Despite the poor condition of the bridge, Draw 1 functions as the primary portal for over 1,100 passenger trains each week into North Station, the fifth-largest transit station in the New England region. These trains are routinely subjected to delays attributable to project components, with 165 unique delay events between 2019 and 2021, and an average operational lag of 24.7 minutes. As regional rail ridership continues to grow, this project is critical to preserving and expanding future service in the Northeast. \n* $217.2 million to the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority for the SouthPort Berth Phase 2: Capacity and Resilient Growth Optimization (CARGO) project in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The project will increase resiliency and expand operational capacity at the Southport terminal by providing approximately ten additional acres adjacent to the Phase 1 berth development and adding a second berth downriver. PhilaPort, recognized as the fastest-growing port on the East Coast, will achieve cost-savings efficiencies from an improved terminal layout and will be more competitive as the project will provide capacity for additional roll-on/roll-off cargo. \n* $68.6 million to the Iowa Department of Transportation for the Southwest Mixmaster Interchange Reconstruction project in Des Moines, Iowa. The project will reconstruct the existing I-35/80/235 interchange, which was constructed in the 1960s and is considered one of the most dangerous in the state. The interchange was built to handle 1,000 vehicles an hour – today, it carries an estimated 1,500 vehicles per hour and is expected to grow to 2,000 per hour by 2050. The reconstruction, which includes new flyover bridges from southbound I-35/80 to eastbound I-235 and to westbound I-80, will improve the safety and reliability of travel for people and freight through the region.\n\n>In today’s round of selections for the INFRA program, for which funding was increased more than 50% by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Biden-Harris Administration is investing $2.58 billion into 36 projects that will improve the safety, efficiency, and reliability of the movement of freight and people in and across rural and urban communities.\n\n*Selected INFRA projects this round include:*\n\n>* $196 million to the Michigan Department of Transportation for the River Raisin Bridge and Interstate 75 Revitalization project in Monroe County, Michigan. The project will replace the deteriorating River Raisin Bridge along I-75 with a new crossing to accommodate estimated future traffic, update and replace six existing structures – including two bridges over class I railroad lines – with new ones designed for a100-year lifespan, and reconstruct over two miles of roadway to improve safety and the efficiency of freight movement along this vital U.S.-Canada trade corridor. The I-75 River Raisin Bridge serves as a vital connection point between Detroit and Toledo and currently serves approximately 61,000 vehicles daily, with 25% being truck traffic. \n* $86.6 million to the Mississippi Department of Transportation for the Improvements to the I-20/I-55 Freight Corridor project in Jackson, Mississippi. The project will update seven bridge structures to meet modern design standards, repair an additional 19 bridge structures, deploy Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) equipment, and resurface approximately 32 miles of roadway to enhance the movement of goods and people and reduce the number of fatal and injury crashes on this critical corridor. The excessively rough road surfaces in the project area cause significant travel delays for both trucks and cars, and the segment of I-55 between US Highway 49 and Pearson Road was identified in 2022 as the 6th worst freight bottleneck in the state.  \n* $66.5 million to the Florida Department of Transportation for the U.S. 1/SR 5 Long Key Bridge Replacement project in Monroe County, Florida. The project will replace the current Long Key Bridge built in 1982. US 1 is the only roadway linkage across the Florida Keys for 113 miles between the mainland and Key West and is a critical emergency evacuation route for the Florida Keys. Additionally, freight movement over the Long Key Bridge is a lifeline supporting the Florida Keys economy – more than 134,000 trucks carrying an estimated $2 billion in freight cross the bridge each year. This replacement project is critical to the 72,000 people and hundreds of businesses located south of the bridge. \n\n>...  \nAs with last year’s awards, despite these historic increases in funding, these programs were significantly oversubscribed. The Department received approximately 200 INFRA and Mega applications requesting more than $27 billion in funding, far exceeding the amount of funding available.  \n\n>Applications for the MPDG grants were evaluated based on the criteria published in the NOFO.
