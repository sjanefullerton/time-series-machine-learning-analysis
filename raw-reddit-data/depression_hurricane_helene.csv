I just don’t know what to do anymore. I feel worthless and useless. 32f,"I’m a 32-year-old woman, but I feel like a walking, talking fuck-up. I just had a discussion with my mom (whom I live with; I live with her husband as well) about the trajectory of my life. Basically, when I am not working, all I do is lay on my bed, scroll mindlessly on my phone, journal, and take naps. I am also severely overweight (I don’t want to post how much I weigh, because I am embarrassed about it). I’m autistic, too. 

I am having a really hard time for at least a few reasons. I don’t know what I should be doing with my life exactly, although I am interested in a career in writing. I am still not 100% sure about it, though. I am currently in a tech support job that I hate, because at least some of the callers are angry, and I feel so helpless when trying to placate them. I also get paid $13 an hour. I live in a small town, so there isn’t much industry here at all. I wish I could do something better. Actually, I have thought about getting into writing (for work, like I said) on a freelance basis, but that kind of work is not stable. My communication skills are also sucky, so I wish I could have a job that didn’t involve much interaction with people at all. 

I do have other interests/hobbies (video games and reading as two examples), but my mind is so weird, because I tend to lose interest in things quickly. My interests and hobbies rotate like a rotisserie chicken. 

More about the bed thing…I wish I weren’t this way, but I spend a WHOLE lot of time in my room, because it is my sanctuary. It could also be because I don’t want constant interaction throughout the day, especially from my parents. I don’t hate them, but I think I am beginning to resent them, because we are in such close quarters. I am 32, so I wish I could have a place all to myself. Then again, I can’t, because I don’t make enough money to afford a nice place, and I really don’t want to live in a bad neighborhood (I’m sorry if that sounds mean). I also don’t want a roommate, because 1) I don’t want to live with a stranger, and 2) I am too stubborn to want to share a kitchen with anyone. 

I do have a gym membership, but I haven’t gone consistently in at least three months (some life things came up that prevented that). I would like to get back into it, though. However, during the evenings, many linemen are spending the night there, due to helping the town out because of Hurricane Helene. 

Here is something that I think is worth mentioning: I have mental health issues (depression, anxiety, OCD, and possible ADHD). I do see a therapist, but I should probably be more honest with her in future sessions, but, like I said, communication is hard for me. I’m wondering if talk therapy is even worth it for me. Are there alternative therapy options for me? 

Wow, that was a lot of writing. Please don’t be mean, because I am between a rock and a hard place right now. Thanks in advance. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1fzgyjk/i_just_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore_i_feel/,1728439849.0,Cancerette,depression,[]
