Hurricane Helene flooded us - lower cabinets and flooring are removed.    Thoughts on what to go back with?,"I’m a bit overwhelmed so wanted to ask for opinions.    Our home had flood damage from Hurricane Helene.    All of the flooring in the home has been removed, as has the lowers.

The second picture is what we are wanting to do for flooring.    We are thinking of going back with white cabinets.    Our dark granite countertops were saved.  

1) Do you think dark granite would look ok with that grey flooring in the second pic and white cabinets?   

2) Would it look bad if we just replaced the lowers with white and then painted the tops?    They are oak.     What might be options there?    Or should we just replace the uppers too?    (That would be out of pocket, insurance won’t cover that).

3) any other recommendations you might have? 

Like I said, we are a bit overwhelmed.     These photos are pre-gutting.      Any direction, advice is appreciated.    If there’s any easy to use website where we could put the photo in and visualize cabinets and flooring, that would help too!  

Thanks in advance for reading.  ",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gdlu9m,1730064701.0,Ashattackyo,kitchenremodel,[]
Hurricane Flooding destroyed our washer and dryer - NO idea where to start with deciding on a new washer/dryer.  Help?,"Our home flooded during hurricane Helene.    We are displaced while our home is being repaired/rebuild.    I'm so overwhelmed with all of the decisions we have to make, and I was wondering if any one can guide me in the right direction for replacing our washer and dryer.    

We had an older top load washer and regular dryer.     We just want something that wont tear our clothes and works well.    It does not have to be fancy.   Preferably something trusted/has been in production for a long time V. the newer ""fancier"" models.  It's just two adults and two dogs in the home.     

What are decent washer/dryer brands and models to replace ours with, that also won't be crazy expensive?    

I usually do a lot of research on things... but with my limited time, energy and resources I thought maybe Reddit could help crowd source some ideas for me.

Anyone can write to me,"Hello, I am from North Carolina in the mountains. Yes the mountains that got wrecked by hurricane Helene.

"18 YO daughter totaled someone else’s car, driving with permission.","My 18 YO daughter was evacuating Hurricane Helene (in FL) with one of her roommates, and driving her roommate's car with her permission. My daughter was over the speed limit and hydroplaned, causing an accident, totaling her roommates car in the process. Fortunately there have been no injuries. 

Roommate submitted a claim to her own insurance and got market value for the car, which is not enough to replace the vehicle. She's pretty upset and asked my daughter to contribute to the cost of replacing her car. We've provided our insurance so she could try to make a claim for additional, but of course our insurance denied the claim. 

Now the roommate is planning to sue my daughter and meeting with a lawyer tomorrow to discuss this. 

My daughter is 18, so a legal adult, but we do the usual stuff that families do for their kids if they can. She's on our insurance, we're helping her pay for college, etc. Am I correct in assuming that if my daughter is sued, we have no liability?

Assuming the roommate proceeds, what's the most likely outcome from all this? Does my daughter need to hire a lawyer?

I may be operating under the faulty assumption that since the roommate allowed her to drive, and was in the vehicle at the time of the accident, that my daughter has no further obligation to pay after the insurance claim was settled. 

My daughter is a broke college kid and doesn't have enough money to buy a car or help someone else buy a car. I'm not inclined to rescue anyone from the consequences of their actions, but I'm also not willing to hang my kid out to dry in a situation outside her experience.

Tell her to never drive someone else car this protects her.""}, {'Comment Author': 'SoftSummerSoul1', 'Comment Body': 'Because your daughter had permission to drive the car, any primary liability for damage falls under the roommate’s insurance. So legally speaking, the insurance has settled the claim as far as the vehicle’s worth goes.

Since your daughter is 18, she’s legally an adult, so no, you as parents aren’t liable. In terms of a lawsuit, she can technically represent herself in small claims if it comes to that, though a quick consultation with a lawyer might give her peace of mind. They could clarify that her “financial responsibility” likely ended with the insurance payout.\n\nThe roommate might just be frustrated and looking for someone to blame, which is understandable after a loss like that. But here’s the bottom line: unless there’s evidence of gross negligence beyond what’s already covered in the insurance payout, this likely won’t go far.

A used car is less likely to have that drop in value.

Advice needed,"We live in SC and have a confirmed termite infestation, despite having a termite bond in place with the Sentricon system.  A few background items to note:
1. Before we bought the home in Oct. 2021, the wood infestation report found one tube on the exterior of the home which was treated.
2. We have a recurring small roof leak around our chimney - this was supposedly fixed prior to purchasing the home in Oct. 2021, and we had a different roofer fix it again in Jan. 2023.
3. Prior to the second roof repair, I found what I was pretty sure was evidence of termites in the attic crawl space.  I called our pest control company who inspected and said there were some old tubes in the attic but nothing active.  He sprayed some Termidor foam in the area to make me feel better.  I showed him another area on a baseboard nearby that he said was old water damage and definitely NOT termites.  I showed him a different area below the fireplace where I had seen some frass below a hole.  He again said not termites, but supposedly shot some foam in the area to make me feel better.

Fast forward to hurricane Helene, and I noticed the baseboard area with old water damage looked wet again.  I also noted new termite tubes in the attic crawl space (other side of chimney from baseboard) and even saw termites after poking around in the damp area.  Called in the termite guys, and this guy acknowledged there was termite activity going on, and says he found one tube in the crawl space on the chimney (which he supposedly inspected back in July).  They don’t do exploratory work, so I had to get another contractor to tear out the baseboard (I insisted that they wait to do the treatment until we opened the area up to see what was going on in there).  The baseboard was crawling with tons of termites. Next week the roof is being repaired again (hopefully) and the technician is coming to treatment the termites.  

While I want to trust them as the professionals, I am leery after our previous experience.  This technician is more experienced than the last guy, but is also the one who does our inspections, so I felt like he was downplaying how bad the situation is to cover the fact that it happened on his watch.  How do I know if the infestation has been successfully treated?  Part of the area where they were found is hard to access as it is in the plywood around the chimney and it’s impossible to see how far down they go towards the first floor.  The contractor who tore the drywall out doesn’t think they got into the floor, but they most likely came up from the ground, so are they all in the walls?  Are there any questions I should be asking or things I should make sure they do?  Thanks for any advice!

"Help, what did I do wrong with my fall TTTF overseeding?","Help, what did I do wrong with my fall overseed?

Feeling extremely frustrated at the money and time I spent on prepping and overseeding my backyard with Lesco blue tag TTTF and now seeing this as the result 3 weeks after watering everyday (minimum 20 min). Soil test indicates perfectly healthy soil. 

Last year we had a guy come out to rip all ivy out of backyard and he used a bobcat so the ground was very compacted from that and also dry from an insanely hot summer. Manually pulled out all the crab grass before aerating to make sure there’d be good seed to ground contact. Full sunlight most of the day. Did not top dress as I’ve had success without it in the past (also to save money and my back). Also, had to wait a week or so after aerating before seeding due to Hurricane Helene rain coming through, could that have recompacted the soil?

Had to wait a couple weeks before seeding due to Hurricane Helene weather coming through, could that have recompacted the soil?

3 weeks later I have a bunch of weeds and barely anything coming up. What did I do wrong? I assume I’m screwed for this season or am I being impatient?

Thank for your help in advance!

To build a new woodworking shop ourselves or buy new? ,"Hurricane Helene demolished our home woodworking shop. The building was old and here when we bought the house, but it was big 16x24 and we built it out to work well for our needs. Insurance gave us about 10k, which isn’t quite enough but we can pitch in a little extra. Now we need to decide whether to build one ourselves or buy a new building. We built a 10x12 building at our previous home. We are pretty handy, but we now have a 1 year old. Is it worth the planning, preparation, and time to build a new one ourselves or should we just buy? Having a hard time coming up with exact numbers to determine if we will really be saving money by building ourselves. I definitely realize by building ourselves we can make it exactly what we want. Either way we only have around 10K-ish to work with. Curious for some feedback.

"Emotionally sensitive cat, thought we had fixed his issues, suddenly started peeing on couch, clean bill of health otherwise ","Recently got back from the vet for my 3 year old grey boy munchkin cat, has a clean bill of health, current shot records, otherwise perfectly healthy says my vet. 

A little background on my cat, he’s a grey munchkin who was a perfectly loving chill cat who was great until I took him to get fixed at our vet. When he came back he was a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT cat. Almost as if he was suffering from PTSD, even slight noises bothered him, he refused to come out for petting and to be social, stayed in quiet dark areas of the house, etc. it took him 6-12 months to finally start being an amazing cat again. We moved into a new house and after a month he turned into the cat he was when we first adopted him. Social, loving, chill, etc. we were both overjoyed…. Until recently. 

We lost power for 10 days due to hurricane Helene but fortunately I had plenty of food, water, and treats to keep him fed during that time so besides the power being out it wasn’t unlivable. 

After the power came back on it’s like he blames me for the issues we faced. He is peeing in the same spot on my couch, and others when I attempted to prevent him from accessing that spot. He’s been being distant, both physically and emotionally by staying in a certain place in the house. I’ve loved on him, talked to him, gave him treats, apologized for the hurricane, etc. but he’s been peeing outside of the litter box ever since the hurricane. 

What do I do? I can’t keep him if he’s treating my new home like a toilet. I’ve worked too hard to let him destroy it. Ive made sure the litter box is always clean and fresh, that he feels loved, that it’s not a diet related issue, he’s completely healthy, etc. 

TLDR; emotional cat is healthy according to vet but has been peeing as a form of protest I assume after dealing with the power bring out for Helene. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1gdf9cc/emotionally_sensitive_cat_thought_we_had_fixed/,1730047483.0,ShowMeYourMoods,CatAdvice,[]

Considering going to their house for medical help,"Im stuck between a rock and a hard place right now.   


Im 32 but I have a *lot* of chronic health problems. Nobody knows more about them than my fiance. Ive also had many experiences of doctors blowing me off, sending me home, telling me scans were normal when they werent, etc. (I had a doctor tell me my scans were normal, and I believed him, until I finally got them in front of another doctor in another state who said two veins in my brain had collapsed and ended up placing two stents in my brain. WP was there for the whole thing).   
  
Im really sick right now. The hospital blew me off even though some of the scans indicated diverticulitis. Hurricane Helene decimated my area. My ex-fiance lives only an hour away but her city is totally fine. 

We still dont even have clean water at my place. I havent even showered. 

I was going to do no-contact for a while and see how things go. But Im really sick and Im desperate for help, and the other person I would normally turn to is my roommate, who is the AP and trying not to take responsibility for it, who I cannot stand and doesnt know nearly as much about my medical stuff.

Finally done….no service again. ,"This weekend, I was at a race in Arizona. My friend had Verizon and could surf. I couldn’t surf at all, and another race person next to me had Spectrum, and she had no service either. 

Luckily I had an AT&T US mobile secondary line. My even having the line, was due to dealing with over a week long outage because of Hurricane Helene. 

There have been other times, where I just couldn’t surf or do anything.

A Mother’s Plea for Help After Hurricane Helene,"I find myself in a position I never imagined I would be in. I am reaching out with a heavy heart, overwhelmed by despair after losing everything in the wake of Hurricane Helene. This storm took not only my home but also my sense of security and stability—everything I worked so hard for was washed away in a matter of hours. I am doing my best to pick up the pieces, but with the chaos left in the storm’s wake, I find myself in urgent need of assistance just to make it through the next couple of weeks. My deepest desire is to return to work to start rebuilding our lives, but I currently lack the funds to cover the hotel expenses for just this short time. With your help, I hope to cover these costs so I can regain my footing and show my daughter that even in the darkest of times, we can rise again.
I am humbly asking for help. Any amount, no matter how small, can make a significant difference as I work towards my goal of securing stable housing and providing for my little girl. I am eternally grateful for any support you can provide—I promise that your kindness will not be forgotten. Thank you for taking the time to read my plea. Your compassion means the world to me and my daughter right now as we navigate through this storm of our lives.

"Given any opportunity, MAGA will take away your vote.","

# 

# As reported, the right-wing's MAGA controlled legislature is still considering ways and methods to set aside election results and just award all of North Carolina's electoral votes to Trump. This is the kind of country they are laying the groundwork for. They advocate for a country where, as Trump promised, the Constitution would be invalidated and governance would be controlled by a cadre of insolent and arrogant seditionists, with no input by the voters of the nation.

In their conceit and hubris, they consider themselves to be above you -- all knowing and paternalistic -- and in their authoritarian fever-dream see themselves on high while the underclass, the untouchables, grovel for scraps.

This is the face of fascism, and they make no attempt at hiding it.

Vote now, while you can. Else, the day will come when the niceties disappear, and all decisions will be made by a chosen few.

It happened in Germany, it happened in China, it happened in North Korea, and preparations are now in full swing for it to happen here in North Carolina, and then throughout the nation.

Our only hope is to vote the tyrants out while we can. The must be defeated by an overwhelming margin and then prosecuted for their criminal insurgence so they will never attempt this scheme again.

See this report -- boldface mine.

""Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., chair of the **right-wing House Freedom Caucus**, suggested North Carolina’s **GOP-controlled legislature should declare former President Donald Trump the winner** of the state’s 16 electors **before votes are finalized,** giving credence to the far-flung scheme that drew bipartisan rebuke on Capitol Hill. Harris said Thursday during a Republican Party dinner in Talbot County, Maryland, that it “**makes a lot of sense”** to convene the legislature early to **certify electoral votes for Trump before they’re finalized,** considering that Hurricane Helene may have disenfranchised voters in some counties ravaged by the storm, many of which are heavily Republican.

Harris was responding to a suggestion from pro-Trump activist Ivan Raiklin advocating for North Carolina and other states to certify their election results before they’re finalized “so that those states guarantee that no illegals are voting, no illegal drop boxes, no illegal signature non verifications going on,” he said during the Thursday meeting, according to a video of the remarks he posted to his X account. Harris suggested **the plan was “legitimate” in North Carolina,** given the devastation from Helene, but questioned whether it would work in other states.

Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., chair of the House Administration committee tasked with overseeing election processes, blasted the plan as a “**blood-chilling scheme,”** in a statement to Politico, adding **“extreme Republican leaders are openly advocating that North Carolina’s electoral votes be given to Donald Trump without an election.”** Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., told reporters Friday he hadn’t heard about the plans discussed in Talbot County but that “it makes no sense whatsoever to prejudge the election outcome. And that is a misinformed view of what is happening on the ground in North Carolina, bless his heart.”

16. That’s how many electoral votes belong to North Carolina, one of the seven swing states that will decide the election. Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are locked in a dead heat there, with Five Thirty Eight’s polling average showing Trump leading by 1.3 points.

**Trump and his allies appear to be gearing up to contest the results of the 2024 election if Trump loses.** While Trump has said he hasn’t seen any signs of fraud so far in the election process and has encouraged his supporters to vote early, he has also said Harris can’t win unless Democrats cheat. **Republicans have already filed a slew of election-related legal challenges this cycle.**

I’m scared about my future.,"I’m in my early 30s and I’m scared that I’m not going to live a secure life. I have a decent job but I have struggled with housing insecurity for years now because I’m from a city with a very high cost of living. I was recently affected by hurricane Helene after trying to start new in a new state and it’s left me feeling so lost and discouraged. I was living with a roommate but the house we were in was inadequate for many reasons that were exacerbated by the hurricane aftermath, so we left that apartment and my roommate moved in with someone she is seeing because her income was affected by the storm.

Now I’m in between crashing a friends places, in a high cost city (put everything in storage and drove back to my home state), not knowing what to do or where to go. I could move to a cheaper city on my own but I don’t think I’m in a good mental space to be in a city where I don’t know anyone. But living alone and paying so much rent that I won’t be able to save much money also feels like a bad option.

 I haven’t been able to take care of myself enough to have a stable home for longer than a year or two. I feel like giving up because it’s just so defeating doing all of this on my own and still ending up in really shitty housing situations.

It’s been so hard to stay afloat with little to no support. The world feels harder to live in every day and I’m basically hanging on by one thread that is my remote job. I can’t even move back in with my parents to reduce some burdens for a while.

Just feels impossible to make it through this life with almost no support. Specially when I’ve already been through so much and feeing beyond burnt out.

I’m feeling so lost and I don’t know how to get out of this loop of disastrous living situations. I don’t know what do when I feel like I really just need help that I can’t get. I don’t know how people keep going like this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1gd9z9u/im_scared_about_my_future/,1730032575.0,nugloomfi,AskWomenOver30,"[{'Comment Author': 'sunflowerdisaster12', 'Comment Body': ""I'm so sorry for what you're going through!

Concerns about flooded vehicles from a hurricane prone dealer,"Admittedly: this is more fictional than anything but it’s a legit concern I have.

I’m considering buying a CPO vehicle from a dealership that’s in the SW Florida area. Think Hurricane Helene/Milton area.

I’m sorry if I’m being a cynical prick, but how could I be sure that I’m not being sold a vehicle that was flooded/ had water damage?",https://www.reddit.com/r/askcarsales/comments/1gd1bx4/concerns_about_flooded_vehicles_from_a_hurricane/,1729996981.0,CubanInSouthFl,askcarsales,"[{'Comment Author': 'NemesisOfZod', 'Comment Body': ""A branded dealership isn't risking their status to sell *you* a car.""}, {'Comment Author': 'RexRaider', 'Comment Body': 'Here are some tips to keep in mind:\n\n\n--\n\nSmell for odors: It’s hard to get the smell of musty carpets and water-logged seat padding out of a car. If you detect an odor, this could be a good indication that stagnant water has sat in the car for a considerable amount of time. On the other hand, if the car is heavily scented with a strong air freshener or cleaner, then you should always be cautious as this could be masking something.\n\n--\n\nInvestigate the interior: Pull back the carpets to look for lingering mud, dirt and water stains. You should also check the trunk for water lines, leftover silt or rust. If the carpets and upholstery appear as though they’ve been replaced recently or look too new for an older car model, this could be another red flag.\n\n--\n\nLook for condensation: Check the dashboard for condensation as there could be moisture lingering in the instrument panels. Water can fry your vehicle’s accessories so you’ll also want to test all of these – dashboard lights, wipers, signal lights, radio, heater, air conditioner and any other switches or options – to make sure they are all in working order.\n\n--\n\nTake a closer look at the little details: Have a look around the car and scrutinize the hard to reach areas and nooks and crannies. Keep an eye out for dried mud, salt stains, rusted bolts, brittle wiring or even mold in areas that never completely dried out.\n\n--\n\nGet a pre-purchase inspection: Take your vehicle to a licensed mechanic for a thorough pre-purchase inspection. This inspection will determine the cosmetic, mechanical and safety condition of the car and can let you know if there is any water damage internally. This is important because while the car may seem perfect on the outside, saltwater or water damage can have lingering effects on the car’s braking, steering and electrical systems. It can take months for this corrosive damage to occur so while the car may be functioning just fine during your test drive, down the road you could run into serious problems. Your mechanic will be able to let you know what’s going on underneath the hood so you don’t have any surprises after you’ve purchased the car.'}, {'Comment Author': 'AutoModerator', 'Comment Body': 'Please review our most [Frequently Asked Questions](/r/askcarsales/wiki/index) to see if your question has already been answered.\n\nYou may find these sections particularly useful;\n\n* [How to pick a car?](/r/askcarsales/wiki/vehicle_selection) You might also have luck in the /r/whatcarshouldibuy subreddit. \n\nAlso remember to add flair to your post by clicking the ""Flair"" link beneath it.

Dealing with trauma post-disaster ,"While I’d rather be anywhere but here in this sub at the moment, I’m realizing I need to find ways to deal with this anxiety. I live in WNC and have been here throughout all of hurricane helene. I was alone in my apartment, just me in my pets, for a week and a half, so afraid at first we wouldn’t be able to get enough food or water. We had no power for 13 days, no cell service at all for 3 so I truly had no way to know if my parents who were trapped by fallen trees were alive or not. We had no running water for almost 3 weeks. Several towns are now gone, and reading yesterday that had the dam near me failed, I would likely be dead along with everyone in its path has just worsened my PTSD anxiety to a level it hasn’t been in a long time. I’m also a nurse at the hospital here and was back at work the Monday after it hit, so not even a break. We didn’t have running water there so we bathed using buckets. Work is still the only place I can get a shower. 

I am anxious about everything now. I go from obsessing over what if my pets and I had drowned along with tens of thousands of people to panic about the election (which was already stressful) to panic about things just so far out of my control it’s crazy. I did okay during the disaster, somewhat, but it’s just all hit me and I am trying to cope. Sleeping is proving pretty difficult with nightmares about drowning. How can I ever feel safe in my home again? 

I have an appointment with a therapist this coming week and I don’t even know how to talk about it. Condensing my OCD/PTSD history and explaining how I feel now just seems so overwhelming but I know I need to go. My anxiety now that the gravity of the situation is hitting is just awful. I don’t want to be crying a couple times a day and afraid to sleep in case something happens. Even light rain is terrifying for us now—it starts and my friends are panicking too because the last time it really rained left whole towns as rubble and killed so many people. 

Thanks for reading—any suggestions as to ways to relax and cope temporarily would be wonderful. I will keep my therapy appointment and I’ve also ordered a trauma journal too. I appreciate anyone who read this.

Straight Talk Home Internet Review,"I recently faced internet issues due to Hurricane Helene, which left my Spectrum service out of commission. After power was restored, I found myself without internet and uncertain about when it would be back. Thankfully, after searching for alternatives, I discovered Straight Talk Home Internet.

I checked several Walmart locations and eventually drove an hour to find one that had it in stock. The installation was incredibly straightforward, and within minutes, I was back online—much easier than my previous experiences with one of the major cellular internet providers.

Now, three weeks in, I can’t praise the service enough! My speeds have been consistently impressive at 195-200 Mbps down and 15-20 Mbps up. For the price, it’s an unbeatable deal! I’m seriously considering canceling my Spectrum service entirely. Highly recommend Straight Talk Home Internet! And No Contract!

I have had a great experience with the service, so far. If you want to try it or if you've recently signed up, enter this code to get reward points for a FREE MONTH of service! Even if you've alraedy signed up, as long as you've signed up within the last 14 days the code will still work.

Honestly, I'm not trying to gain anything so use the code if you want. I just wanted to share my results with the service.

Straight Talk Home Internet Review,"I am in a rural area and recently faced internet issues due to Hurricane Helene, which left my Spectrum service out of commission. After power was restored, I found myself without internet and uncertain about when it would be back. Thankfully, after searching for alternatives, I discovered Straight Talk Home Internet.

I checked several Walmart locations and eventually drove an hour to find one that had it in stock. The installation was incredibly straightforward, and within minutes, I was back online—much easier than my previous experiences with one of the major cellular internet providers.

Now, three weeks in, I can’t praise the service enough! My speeds have been consistently impressive at 195-200 Mbps down and 15-20 Mbps up. For the price, it’s an unbeatable deal! I’m seriously considering canceling my Spectrum service entirely. Highly recommend Straight Talk Home Internet!

I have had a great experience with the service, so far. If you want to try it or if you've recently signed up, enter this code to get reward points for a FREE MONTH of service! Even if you've alraedy signed up, as long as you've signed up within the last 14 days the code will still work.

Honestly, I'm not trying to gain anything so use the code if you want. I just wanted to share my results with the service.

The code is:

Major disappointment,"Hi, throwaway account here because I’m so ashamed. I have been on the 0.25 dosage for a few weeks. I was doing very well on it and lost almost 8lbs and then disaster hit. My family was heavily affected by hurricane Helene and then my parents were directly hit by hurricane Milton. I began to eat badly because of the pure stress and anxiety. I now feel as though my sema is just not working at all, all my food noise is back and I feel like a failure. I’ve gained all 8lbs back plus a couple more. I’m due to order my next dose of Sema on the 1st which will be 0.5mg. Is the higher dosage possibly going to help with the food noise like the original starter dose did? Sorry for the rant, I just had to get it out and I’m so disappointed and upset with myself.

♦️♦️HURRICANE RELIEF♦️♦️ ,"Help TGI Fridays Asheville Employees Rebuild After Hurricane Helene

Hi everyone,

I'm reaching out on behalf of my colleagues and myself—loyal employees of TGI Fridays in Asheville, North Carolina. Many of us dedicated years, some even decades, to this location. I’ve personally worked here for 7 years, and several of my coworkers have put in 23–24 years of service. Sadly, Hurricane Helene devastated Asheville, and the company decided to close this location permanently. This decision was a shock to all of us, as we were left without support or a clear plan for what’s next.

Our team is like family, and we’re turning to the community for help during this difficult time. We’ve set up a GoFundMe to help cover basic living expenses, rent, and medical needs as we navigate this sudden loss of income. Any support, whether through donations or even just spreading the word, would mean the world to us.

Thank you for reading, and thank you to anyone who’s able to lend a hand.

Solar Generator from Sam’s Club - thoughts?,"Hey y’all! I think this might be my first post here. Maybe not but I figured this would be the best place to ask about this. Normally I think to post in Prepper fb groups but lately people have been rude as hell, nasty, and just encapsulating the personality of a stale fart with each-other. I hope to find kinder mentalities here with my fellow Two XXers. 

What are your thoughts on this? I’ve been eyeballing a solar one for a bit. We have a gas/propane one that powered us during Hurricane Helene and Milton outages (west coast central FL.) It’s 6250 watts running and it powered almost the whole house minus the AC, and we elected to not run our range/stove and fridge with the ice maker machine (garage fridge was a wayyyy less power draw.)

 With every event like this you learn something new. We saw some serious fuel usage concerns with it and the local area, we didn’t fly thru fuel as we were hyper aware and conservative but the local area couldn’t get fuel for a few days due to Port Tampa being down, and people really showed their asses here. We had 25 gallons of gas ready and 3 standard propane tanks. Plus 8 baby propane tanks for the Coleman camp stove. But it did start to make me a little nervous to acknowledge we had used 1 and a half 5 gallon containers over about 2 and a half days with conservative rotation (keeping freezers and fridge cool, our bearded dragon’s light on, and the well cycled for our livestock primarily.) 

We did use our inverter and batteries to keep our bearded dragon’s light on, but noticed it drew quickly. So I’m considering other ways to power his light when we want to give the fuel burner a break. We have a big solar panel and set up to charge those batteries but as I mentioned above, we learned how quickly some of those drained. So then this guy popped up on my radar today while online grocery shopping, after I had been eyeballing some on Amazon.

Figured it would be a good idea to ask the hive mind, what you think of this little gadget for the arsenal! It would be nice to be able to power small things at night too from inside the house, as we shut it off and rolled it in at night to prevent theft. 

Thanks in advance!

And eco flow does a lot of great stuff with software and how they build/package their devices. \n\nSolar generators are fantastic but need to know their limitations and what power draw you’ll do to scale up or down. Bigger systems will have a higher inverter power draw so they’ll lose more power at idle when on, but they can handle bigger loads too. Smaller units are fantastic for portability and running small things with little power draw.

SUNDAY 1 to 7pm. Free clothing swap and coat drive,"**Into the Wardrobe: Burnwear Exchange/Coat & Winter Supply Drive

Please join us as Go Frock Yourself pops up once again, this time in downtown Durham. In addition to hosting spoils of eclectic outfits and costumes to refresh your wardrobe, we will be collecting donations for those impacted by Hurricane Helene. This is a free event.

We’ll have friends, old and new, music, hot spiced cider, snacks, and scads of free stuff. Come meet, greet, and score big. BYOB and anything you’d like to share. Bring a chair, if you’d like - this is a bright and lofty unfurnished space

Ours is not your everyday clothing swap. We encourage you to bring intentional gifts of apparel and accessories that inspire and delight, but you need not bring anything at all. All flavors of fun, fierce, and fabulous welcome. Please leave the normcore, office casual, and nasty t-shirts at home. Further details and guidelines to come in the comments.

For donation, we are seeking coats, jackets, blankets, sleeping bags, raingear, hats, scarves, gloves, thermals, new socks, new underwear, diapers, and incontinence and menstrual supplies. Donations will be directed to WNC through Triangle Mutual Aid. (See comments for a link to updating list of requests.) No donation is required to participate in the swap!

The venue is a second-floor commercial space accessible by the alley on Orange Street between W. Parrish and Chapel Hill Streets. Street parking and the Chapel Hill Street deck/lot are free on Sunday. 

Warm fuzzies will abound! See you there!

Fall lawn renovation “complete”,"We bought our house (zone 8a btw) this summer and lawn was in decent shape but it was mostly weeds/mixed grass types and I wanted TTTF so we started the rigorous process of renovating our lawn. At a point now where I think I can post a renovation complete update even though I know it will never fully be complete. Here was my process:

1. Started nuking my lawn first week of September with glysophate (I pretty much kept my dogs inside/walked them a lot since the start of this project to avoid unwanted chemicals, prevent them getting muddy, and killing the new grass). Grass was pretty much dead after a couple of weeks.
2. Scalped lawn, scarify which helped bring the lawn to bare dirt, and aerated using a rental from Lowe’s
3. Brought in a tri-axle load of topsoil to do some leveling work and add nutrients back into the soil. This was by far the hardest and most time consuming part since my lawn is just under 10k sqft would not recommend lol. 
4. Threw down about 90lbs of TTTF from GCI as well as about 25lbs of Johnathan Green dense shade mix around the trees. Raked it then rolled it in but did not throw any pete moss on top. Having some sort of cover probably would have been helpful but would have costed way too much for roughly 10k sqft so I just made sure that the seed was well incorporated into the dirt.
5. Added some starter fertilizer and then just watered it like crazy. Fortunately, I work from home so I could go out and water the areas that the sprinkler couldn’t reach. I used a couple of orbit timers that I set to run every 6 hours but would also manually run them on some of the hotter days at peak temps.

The bad:
Hurricane Helene came through the weekend after I threw down the seed and had some major wash out (as you can see from the picture of a river running through my back yard). All things considered I am pretty fortunate that it did not do any more damage other than a bit of seed washing into my neighbor’s lawn. Still meant that I had to buy another 45lb bag of seed and fix all the washout areas. There are still quite a few bare patches that I am just gonna have to accept and fix next year. And yes I checked the weather beforehand, did not realized it was gonna hit us that hard but you live and you learn.

STOBETTER S4E3: Heritage and Hangar Bays,"Hello, and welcome to our penultimate update for the year. This time, we’re featuring content from the Heritage bundle, updated builds and guides based on hangar research, and a slew of other new content to explore. 

If you’re new to our site, our goal is to be the best resource for STO combat mechanics information anywhere and a top-tier guides/build resource for PvE gameplay on both space and ground from level 50 to 1.5M DPS. Our core competencies are mechanical knowledge, process, tools, and technical writing/presentation. Shipbuilding is an application of that knowledge, but we're also not trying to chase the peak ISE/HSE/BHE meta super hard. As always, you can find us at: https://www.stobetter.com

#Builds

##Jay

* [Durgath](https://www.stobetter.com/intro-builds/jay/kinetic-durgath) *It’s been a loooong time, getting from there to here. It’s been a loooong road, but the Durgath is finally here*. (*Editor’s Note: I thought we said he was no longer allowed to sing!*)

* [Friendship](https://www.stobetter.com/intro-builds/jay/carrier-friendship) Jay has been keeping up with all of the new carrier toys and now his Friendship is the highest-performing carrier we’ve personally seen or flown with at 1177K, with over 55% from pets.

* The [Hydra](https://www.stobetter.com/intro-builds/jay/ss-hydra) slept silent for awhile, allowing a RRTW build to shine as our energy leader, but now it has awoken and reclaimed the energy DPS site record at 1400K. Hail Hydra!

* [Atlantis](https://www.stobetter.com/intro-builds/jay/bo-atlantis) Jay has his first midrange build and it’s a newer concept for him, Beam Overload on the Atlantis

##Eph289

* I’ve hinted at this already on reddit several times, but I have actually built a real carrier this time on the [Herald Vonph](https://www.stobetter.com/intro-builds/eph289/carrier-vonph). I’ve had a Vonph collecting dust for years and this was a good opportunity to take all my collected carrier knowledge and put it to use with new content from the Heritage bundle. It’s up to 1072K, of which over half of that damage is from pets

* The [Eagle](https://www.stobetter.com/intro-builds/eph289/kinetic-eagle) is now up to 1536K with some new toys from the Heritage bundle and is our first build to crack 1.5M DPS. 

* The [Support Hiawatha](https://www.stobetter.com/intro-builds/eph289/support-hiawatha) is now freshly refitted with the Subspace Fracture Tunneling Field console for even more cooldowns and is up to  244K / 531% debuff

* My [ERL Gagarin](https://www.stobetter.com/intro-builds/eph289/erl-achilles) has been transferred to the Achilles and, now with Hexa-cannons, is our first ERL build above 1M DPS at 1019K.

##Tilor

* With the release of the [Typhon](https://www.stobetter.com/intro-builds/tilor/kinetic-typhon), we finally have an Economy-tier Torper on our site. While not quite the highest-DPS of our Economy line of builds, it’s not far off at 840k. It’s not quite a carrier build, but could be a stepping stone in that direction.

* Tilor’s [Tzen-tar](https://www.stobetter.com/intro-builds/tilor/kinetic-tzen-tar) is now his highest DPS ship at 1338K and sporting some shiny new upgrades.

#[Editorials](https://www.stobetter.com/editorials)

We’re adding this section to help explain stances/decisions we’re making. For example, why we’re testing on solo ISA, why we don’t use the Fleet Power Network Array, and what we’re doing about Tilor’s reddit being gone.

#Feedback Form

The list of dropdowns was getting unsustainably long, so we’ve condensed it. Yay, no more doomscrolling!

#Guides

* [Carrier Basics](https://www.stobetter.com/new-f2p/carrier-basics) has had some nominal updates to account for new heritage bundle content and point to the tier lists

* [Progression](https://www.stobetter.com/guides/progression) has been updated for Heritage/13th bundle content and a Carrier section

* All the [Revisiting Exotics](https://www.stobetter.com/guides/revisiting-exotics) are now under Guides and Tilor did some cleanup on them to condense them.

#ICYMI

* [Revisiting Exotics 23](https://www.reddit.com/r/stobuilds/comments/1g23lz5/revisiting_exotics_23_captain_proton_and_lolah/) covers a couple of newer Proton consoles and Cascading Gravimetric Disruptions.

* [Mathbusters 9: Advanced Cooldowns and Uncon](https://www.reddit.com/r/stobuilds/comments/1dquarf/mathbusters_9_advanced_cooldowns_and_uncon/) covered cooldown mechanics for channels and Unconventional Systems (Editor’s Note: it does not cover Subspace Fracture Tunneling Field, aka Vovin console)

* [Mathbusters 10: Heritage Bundle Pet Testing](https://www.reddit.com/r/stobuilds/comments/1emkud0/mathbusters_10_heritage_bundle_pet_testing/)

* [Torpedo Effects and Damage 7: Event Torpedoes and Ship Consoles](https://www.reddit.com/r/stobuilds/comments/1evg75j/torpedo_effects_and_damage_7_event_torpedoes_and/)

#[Tier Lists](https://www.stobetter.com/tier-lists)

* We have a Carrier Starship Trait / Personal Trait / Duty Officer section of the tier list now (doffs are really just Flight Deck Officers)

* We have updated the survivability doff tier list slightly for Dal R’el and the Na’kuhl space warfare specialist for exotic builds (is quite good actually)

* We have updated the tier list for traits from the Heritage bundle as well

* We revamped our presentation of carrier pets as well to clean it up and added data for Elite Type 7s and Elite Valors

#[Tools](https://www.stobetter.com/tools)

* With thanks to /u/ShmooDude993, we have updated the CDR tool to better account for channel cooldowns and fix some errors, now up to version 3.9. 

* TRINITY -  a handful of new exotic consoles from Revisiting Exotics 23, Temporal Tunneling, Portal of the Damned, and Flagship Staffing. We also added Breen 2-and-3 piece and corrected an issue where manual override of uptimes wasn’t working, applied -DRR from DRB correctly and fixed its cooldown.  Now at version 1.7

* ALICIA - Added consoles from the Achilles, Lo’laH, Premonition, Vovin, Obelisk Carrier, Friendship, and the Pahvan Crystal Battery. Now at version 0.9.1.

#[Printables](https://www.stobetter.com/guides/printables)

Tilor has updated his printable for boff cooldowns with a few minor updates to cooldowns. There’s also a new printable on Upgrades! This should be your go-to guide for the best way to upgrade your gear.

#[Videos](https://www.youtube.com/@stobetter)

* We’ve added tutorials for Gateway to Gre’thor, Brotherhood of the Sword, and some bonus videos showing how we do our testing. Also, Tilor posted a Fractal Integrity Bleed build breakdown for maximum hull-scaling damage and an upgrade video. 

#Thanks

Our continued thanks for members outside the immediate team who nevertheless have contributed immeasurably to our success:

* Everyone who has donated to Tilor to help him and his family recover from Hurricane Helene. 

* Mrs. Eph289, who’s been supportive of a lot of gaming and spreadsheet time, and has been flying support to help us push our builds. You remain my favorite captain to fly with, forever!

* Our good friend Grim, who has been such a huge help!

* Our fleetmates in Zion Fleet/Terran Imperial Guard who accompany us on our hijinks, specifically Mickster

* /u/DivisionMuEpsilon, who helped teach us how to use the Vovin console and has been flying with us some as well

* /u/Pottsey-X5 who's clued us in to several new toys our carriers have benefitted from

#Giveaways

As a way of saying thanks to all of you who supported Mr. Tilor and his family during recovery, we have some giveaways to offer. To enter, either leave a comment on the reddit thread or send us a Google form response with the keyword “Helene” in it. We’ll draw winners in 2 weeks on 9 November!

* 1 Infinity Prize Pack (T5) - keyword T5, not T6

* 1 Mk XV Epic Plasma Isomag

* Romulan Survivor Duty Officer Pack

* 1 Mk XV Epic Disruptor Hangar Craft Power Transmission

* 4 Lockbox keys

#What’s Next

I’m itching to start optimizing my other two Exotic builds with some new toys and still have a handful of builds to X2, update, and re-test. Look for updates to the Damar, Dranuur, Support Scimitar, and Lexington next time. Tilor is building out an Economy-tier tank. Jay has some older builds he wants to update.  For TFO tutorials, we’ll be tackling Khitomer Vortex, and a TFO of YOUR CHOICE to finish out the year. Fill out the [survey](https://forms.gle/KmDYa7EMy9rr84aG7) to vote. It’ll remain open until the end of the month!

Lessons from Helene,"I live just outside Asheville and thought I would share some prepping lessons from Hurricane Helene. I don’t consider myself an advanced prepper but having spent a career in the military and having lived in hurricane zones I know the importance of some preparation. 

What worked well:
1.  Having a small inverter generator to keep the refrigerator and chest freezer running. My Westinghouse i2200  burns very little fuel and is relatively quiet. We used it for some other minor things as well and it performed flawlessly. 
2. Having a small solar generator to power electronics, a fan, and a dc light. I originally got it to keep the internet running but we lost internet access. So I used it to power a small TV with an OTA antenna. That and an AM radio were our only sources of information.
3. Having a camping stove and a battery powered camping shower made life much easier.
4. Having gas, food and batteries on hand was helpful. I also used my Dewalt and Metabo work lights at night since I had several batteries for each.
5. Not having to do any shopping for a week saved much frustration. There were long lines and limited supplies for the first few days. Also, many places could only take cash.

What I need to improve:
1. You can never have too much water on hand. I had a little over 70 gallons, not counting bottled water and gallon size jugs of water.  Part of my long term plan was to capture rain water and filter it. I don’t have a permanent system but have tarps I can set up on a temporary basis. Only problem was that it didn’t rain for weeks after the storm. The Asheville water system had previously only been down for 3 days max during the 2004 storms. 
2. Don’t underestimate any storm. I could see the evidence two days ahead but for some reason I underestimated this storm. It was an error in judgment, previous history in this area and the amount of rain we got before the hurricane should have made me realize what could happen. 


Edit: I should add for those not aware that the Asheville water system was totally out of commission for three weeks. Once water started flowing again it was and still is non potable. They are basically sending water straight from the reservoir into the pipes and adding some chlorine. It’s bypassing the treatment plant because of all the sediment. We have no idea when we’ll get potable water again.

Please assist my Godparents’ during this trying time ,"My name is Hayden H. The purpose of this is to raise as much money as I can for my beloved godparents, Steph and Sam Tate. Earlier this year, my godfather retired after dedicating 35 years of service to the U.S. Navy. Never could they fathom that they would be rebuilding their forever home, instead of vacationing.

They have been devastated and displaced from their home in Spartanburg, South Carolina due to Hurricane Helene’s wrath. The flooding has destroyed mostly everything inside—furniture, clothing, and irreplaceable personal effects—and now they’re facing the overwhelming task of rebuilding their home and lives.

Unfortunately, my godparents didn’t have flood insurance. The financial burden is immense, with repair costs expected to range from $15,000 to $75,000, in addition to the expenses of temporary housing and replacing everything they've lost. Preserving and starting the cleanup process, the journey ahead will be challenging. I’m asking for your help to raise $75,000 to cover these urgent costs and give my godparents a safe place to live again.

Any contribution you can make, big or small, will go a long way in helping my godparents rebuild their forever home. Every little bit counts! Also, sharing this campaign with your network would also mean the world!

Looking for seeds and want to help support WNC?,"Hi everyone! (Mods, please feel free to remove if this isn’t allowed) I’m an Asheville NC local and have been gardening for about 5 years now. I wanted to share a local Asheville/WNC business that I personally purchase my seeds + bulbs from. They are donating 20% of their profits to Hurricane Helene Relief from now until November 15th. If you are wanting seeds, gifts, anything gardening related I cannot recommend this place enough. Their seed & bulb quality is exceptional (just got some garlic & shallots from them). Not to mention they are employee owned and an excellent resource for gardening in our community. WNC is still in very rough shape. Anything helps.

Hurricane paths and the future,"I live in western north carolina smack dab in the middle of the path of hurricane Helene. I've had a lot of thoughts and conversations along a similar vein that I've found myself thinking I really wish I knew some one that knew about meteorology, and then I remembered the internet exists. 

The biggest thing I'd love to hear thoughts on is, could this happen again. With so much talk about how this is truly unprecedented, and a once in a thousand year storm, it's hard for me to believe that climate change couldn't just throw those thoughts out the window.  I've heard plenty of talk about climate change making hurricanes more powerful and frequent but can things like shifting ocean currents make certain paths like smack dab into the mountains a more regular thing? Is this something that's being talked about and predicted or are we just truly in a wait and see situation?

Thanks in advance and I look forward to yalls thoughts!

This means storms may have impacts further into land, if they happen to drift that way. We are putting more energy into the system, but can't predict where it'll be better or worse.\n\nRain bomb type storms will always spell trouble for upper drainage basin communities like those affected by Helene. We are making it easier for water to gang up, basically.""}, {'Comment Author': 'Alternative_Talk562', 'Comment Body': ""Based on history, it can absolutely happen again. It happened in 1916 and 1940. \n\nWe are having wetter storms, like the recent floods in Tennessee and Kentucky that dropped more than a foot of rain.  \n\nAnd with warming, Gulf storms are forecast to get wetter. They haven't really developed yet a number for how much wetter the limit could be.""}, {'Comment Author': 'Cool_Roof2453', 'Comment Body': 'It’s important to remember that a 1 in 1000 or 1 in 100 year storm is a reference to probability, as based on historical conditions. \n\nSo for a 1 in 2 year storm, you are tossing a coin each year with a 50/50 chance of getting that storm. \n\nFor a 1 in 6 year storm, imagine you’re throwing a six sided die. You throw that die each year. If you roll a 1, big storm. It might take 10 throws (10 years) or it might only take two. \n\nFor a 1 in 20 year storm think of rolling a 1 on a 20 sided D and D die. Doesn’t happen often but really sucks when it does, you take that chance every time you roll. Can it happen a few times in a row?  Not likely but certainly possible. \n\nUnder known historical conditions for a 1 in 1000 year storm, a 1000 sided die gets rolled each year.\n\nUnfortunately climate change is changing the baseline conditions and nobody really knows yet what new dice are being rolled in the game.'}, {'Comment Author': 'MaverickFegan', 'Comment Body': 'The statistics are a difficult one to quantify, 1/1000 events are only valid based on what we know now. \n\nThere’s a good example of the early use of statistics and forecasting hurricane track/intensity in the book Isaac’s Storm by Erik Larson, which build up to the 1900 Hurricane that hit Galveston. There is an example in there about earlier hurricanes defying statistics, it’s also interesting to read about the decision making, the way people reacted, the impacts which were pretty horrific. \n\nFrom my own experience of hurricane season there were many hurricanes that we worried about but only one that hit, we have to prepare for the storm as the difference between a windy day with blue skies and a hurricane is often a comparatively small change that is hard to quantify when you are just a small point on a map.

It was a strong hurricane  \n2.) Very large size, which meant more moisture and more energy  \n3.) Fast forward speed, which allowed these to persist farther inland than normal before weakening.  \n4.) An interaction with a cutoff low which caused the hurricane to stall after landfall and hover over one area.\n\nClimate change has been researched to be linked with 3/4 of these factors.  \n1.) A higher percentage of future hurricanes will reach category 4/5 strength as well. Computer simulations have estimated that climate change was responsible for an additional \\~10 mph of strength in Helene compared to how strong the hurricane would have been in a pre-industrial environment. The average landfalling hurricane will become more destructive in the future.  \n2.) Hurricanes will become larger and wetter. Warmer air can hold more moisture. Warmer water fuels increased convection. This will continue increasing the amount of energy in the atmosphere that a hurricane has to work with, and thus will result in increased rainfall as well as larger/stronger storms. Large wet hurricanes can cause much more flooding.  \n3.) Helene's fast forward speed was an anomaly. The long-term trend is actually for slower-moving hurricanes. Hurricanes like Harvey, Florence, and Dorian which stall at landfall are going to become increasingly common, as opposed to hurricanes which are booking it at landfall like Helene.  \n4.) As just mentioned, stalling after landfall will grow increasingly common. It won't always be due to a cutoff low like Helene, but this inland stalling, regardless of their cause, means significantly enhanced risk of flooding due to tropical rains parking over the same area for multiple days.  \n\\[So, conflicting factors between those final 2 things.\\]""}, {'Comment Author': 'jimb2', 'Comment Body': 'Storm formation, development, intensity and path is down to a lot of factors so has a high level of randomness.  That\'s the key to understanding.  There are physical factors that make storms more likely in some places than others but what actually happens is effectively random.  So, big storms are not likely but they equally likely any year.  Like if you throw six heads in a row, the chance of the next throw being heads is just one half, like any other throw.   That\'s just how random works.\n\nA ""one in a thousand year storm"" is a bit poetic, of course.  It\'s just a Big Number, not a real analysis.  There are good reasons to believe that global warming will increase frequency and intensity of these extreme events, so the past may not be a good guide to the future.  People want to ascribe individual events to global warming but this is basically wrong-headed.  Thinking in terms of chance or frequency is more realistic.'}, {'Comment Author': 'fatalexe', 'Comment Body': 'It was pretty bad back when I lived in Asheville for the 2004 hurricane caused flood.

What kind of pest might this be. ,"Hi, everyone. I’ve found these slightly rice sized pellets under the bathroom sink (2 bedroom 2 bathroom single family home). There were about three to four of them in the cabinet. Wondering if it could be rodents or insects. Saw one large roach (not sure what kind, but it wasn’t a water bug, and it was somewhat resistant to Raid spray) in the same bathroom about 3 weeks ago. We usually don’t see these kinds of insects, and although I use an insecticide spray and clean routinely, I know that pests are still a possibility. We live in the southeast(GA), and our area was hit hard by Hurricane Helene. I plan on calling an exterminator. I’m wondering how much to expect to pay. Is there a difference in strategy for rodents vs. insects? Could I identify and solve the issue myself? Should I tell my wife about all of this?

Vizio M512 Soundbar and Sub issue,"I have a less than 2 year M512 Vizio soundbar system. I got flooded in hurricane Helene and my sub got salt water in it, not good. Dried it out but no power on the sub.  
  
So, like I have done before with other Vizio systems I bought a used M512 Sub on ebay. I found out after many, many hours with Vizio support that these systems are now paired in the factory. No way to pair non matching serial numbers.  
  
Has anyone been able to find a work around or hack that works? Or is there something inside the damaged sub that I can bring over to the used sub to get them to pair?  
  
Hate that you can no longer buy a used part an get it to work with the M series. And I hate to use this system without the sub and satellite speakers.  
  
Soundbar works fine and I can not update the firmware because it needs to update the sub too and if it does not pair then... it just sits there.  
  
Anyone have any ideas?
